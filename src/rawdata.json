They talk about everything from slavery and Indian reservations to fracking and cannabis; from Aaron Burr to Marilyn Monroe via Truman Capote, and everyone has something to say about Donald Trump – love him or hate him.\n\nBeautifully observed, with candour, insight and humour, this is a vivid and timely portrait of small-town USA as the country heads towards the election in November 2020.\n\n[Click here](http://assets.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/ZhNvEHsv7Xi7SIcB1XUZf/7dc5e5b42071dc726c82fddfe40d03fd/slowroad_samplerA5_email.pdf) to read a sample of *Slow Road to San Francisco*.\n\n[Watch the book trailer now!](http://videos.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/HH8kjyqbFwBoJmkEhMauZ/1a582f6a40e87275f1d5db48c7a11c98/promo6.mp4)","shorterBlurb":"‘An absorbing, perpendicular odyssey…travelling on back roads and stopping frequently to take the pulse of Trump’s America' *Editor’s Choice, The Bookseller*\n","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5VPjMOUvZkByS6ISvhX1Xg","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-05-23T09:08:30.301Z","updatedAt":"2020-05-23T09:08:30.301Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"David Reynolds","biography":"David Reynolds was one of the founders of Bloomsbury Publishing and is now a director of Old Street Publishing.

So when Ricky a charming Aussie, shows up and offers Alistair a job recruiting tourists to pose for his wealthy boss, Heinrich, a charismatic, German artist, Alistair accepts. \n\nHe soon realises that it is more than just painting that Heinrich has in mind. Swept away on a tide of wild parties, wild sex, fine food and drugs Haston sheds his reserve and throws himself headlong into the pursuit of pleasure. Until, the body of a missing tourist is found and the finger of blame points to Haston. \n\nHis world collapses.

These are stories that argue for nuance in a world that wants to make things black and white.","shorterBlurb":"'Golnoosh Nour’s unflinching writing explores sex and religion, love and cruelty, and rebellion and identity, with energy, precision and poise’ Nell Stevens","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1tLLcIkcGDk2cLPy3jrdt0","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-02-03T18:20:10.434Z","updatedAt":"2020-02-03T18:20:10.434Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Golnoosh Nour","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"4rDefZdTgY25d9mRkDN3L5","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2020-02-03T18:18:13.964Z","updatedAt":"2020-02-03T18:18:13.964Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Nour","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/4rDefZdTgY25d9mRkDN3L5/37bfa94e3986e3298938848234f45afc/Golnoosh.jpg","details":{"size":57463,"image":{"width":638,"height":960}},"fileName":"Golnoosh.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"biography":"Golnoosh Nour was born in Tehran and studied English Literature at Shahid Beheshti University, after which she moved to London to do an MA in Creative Writing.

Her work as a perfumer is no longer providing solace and her sense of self is withering. Then, her former lover resurfaces, decades after the end of their bisexual affair, and her world tilts irreversibly. Set in Paris and Provence, this is an intimate portrait of a woman navigating conflicting desires and a troubled past whilst dreaming of a fulfilling future.\n\n__Sarah Beal and Kate Beal at Muswell Press:__\n‘This is a wonderfully compelling novel about desire, loneliness and the impact of time on relationships. We loved Isabel’s first novel, Paris Mon Amour and we are big fans of her Literary Sofa blog so we are delighted to be publishing *Scent*’\n\n__Isabel Costello:__\n‘Like many women over 40 I want to see the complicated reality of our lives represented in fiction.

The first title to be published in the UK, Bloody Foreigners, will be published in June 2020 with the next two titles in Spring 2021. The books are currently being developed as an international TV series by 108 Media.\n\n\"Bloody Foreigners is set in an angry and divided London, one obsessed with foreigners,\" reads the synopsis. \"A murdered Asian student and some racist graffiti in Chinatown threaten to trigger the race war that the white supremacists of Make England Great Again have been hoping for. They just need a tipping point. He arrives in the shape of Detective Inspector Stanley Low. He’s brilliant. He’s bipolar. He hates everyone almost as much as he hates himself. Singapore doesn’t want him, and he doesn’t want to be in London. There are too many bad memories.\"\n\nKate and Sarah Beal said: \"We are really delighted to be publishing such a gritty, engrossing and timely thriller. Detective Inspector Stanley Low is a brilliantly contrary, yet charismatic character and we are thrilled to welcome him and his hugely talented creator Neil Humphreys to the burgeoning Muswell crime list.\"\n\nHumphreys, who is based in Singapore, grew up in Dagenham and went to University in Manchester. He now lives in Singapore, where he writes for various publications and broadcasts on TV and radio.  He has published many award-winning children’s books, travelogues and several novels, said Muswell. This is his first book to be published in the UK.\n\nHe added: \"After 20 years as an author, I'm truly delighted that I am being published in the UK for the first time, with an excellent crime thriller publisher. I am genuinely excited about the potential for Bloody Foreigners. The dark subject matter seems to become more prescient by the day. I can't wait for British readers to meet Detective Inspector Stanley Low, a Chinese misanthrope thrown into the middle of a divided Britain and dealing with both a racist serial killer who can't stop killing foreigners and an ex-girlfriend who wants to kill him.\"","news":true,"date":"2019-11-12","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5zcjaET4j4GPCqmVVLuCY7","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-11-12T20:58:17.499Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-12T20:58:17.499Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"The Bookseller logo","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/5zcjaET4j4GPCqmVVLuCY7/39e8759395959722bb5dc5c3af3e8bd9/og-image.jpg","details":{"size":58765,"image":{"width":1080,"height":1080}},"fileName":"og-image.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1HgOtv6Jvffz7gFjNBbFOt","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-11-12T20:47:25.467Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-12T20:47:25.467Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"book"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"For Your Convenience - A Classic 1930's Guide to London Loos","releaseDate":"2019-11-07T00:00+01:00","bookEdition":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"66XlQYKfgN1JDzjIaqPrnM","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-11-12T20:40:08.749Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-12T20:40:08.749Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"For Your Convenience Hardback","format":"Hardback","isbn":"9781999313555","price":"7.99","dimensions":"178 x 110 mm","pageCount":"80","amazonProductCode":"B07Z8HXJ4G"}}],"blurb":"A facsimile guide to the Gents Loos of London published originally in 1937 by Routledge.

Now faithfully reproduced for the first time in over eighty years, this fascinating book works as both a wry and playful slice of social history as well as a fascinating insight into the perils and pleasures of a most specific activity for men who loved men. The book could be read at as an entertaining guide to London’s public conveniences but yet to our more sceptical eye it is patently a guide to where men could meet like-minded men in an era when homosexuality was illegal.

Her family left Austria for the UK in 1937 to escape the rise of Nazism. A talented linguist, Marlene worked post-war for the UN in Italy helping to rebuild the country and then onto war torn Congo.

Their appeal is global, as Golnoosh writes in her dedication, they are ‘for all the queers’.\n\n‘It is an absolute delight to be the first ‘original’ to be published by this new initiative from Muswell Press.

Ostensibly a guide to where a gentleman may find ‘relief’ in the metropolis after ‘three cups of tea’, for those ‘in-the-know’ the information held between its pages offered a much more tantalizing prospect. Now faithfully reproduced for the first time in over eighty years, this fascinating book works as both a wry and playful slice of social history as well as a fascinating insight into the perils and pleasures of a most specific activity for men who loved men.\n\n9781999313555 November 2019 hardback 178 x 110mm £ 7.99\n\n### *__The Gaudy Image – William Talsman__*\n‘First published in Paris in 1958 this explicit account of New Orleans gay life so shocked customs officials that they seized the novel and confiscated it. Neglected, unread, and, for the main, sadly forgotten it nevertheless has achieved a quiet cult status and been praised by critics for its ‘refreshing honesty and frankness, its playful humour and startling bursts of wit and poetry’.\n\nThe gay underworld of New Orleans is brought vividly to life through Talman’s hero(ine), Thomas Schwartz - or “Titania” as known by his friends - ‘the sloppiest slut who ever slinked down a side-street’. Crude, irreverent, tragic, and heart-breaking, this classic novel has drawn comparisons to both James Baldwin and Tennessee Williams and will appeal to readers of Andrew Holleran’s *Dancer from the Dark* and Neil Bartlett’s *Ready To Catch Him Should He Fall*.\n\n97819916129238 November 2019 bpb 198 x129 mm 8.99\n\n![9781916129221](//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/7EhI1myZWmcNosqwtpb4A8/da633cccab1cce72715c72d1703bf607/9781916129221.jpg)\n\n### __*The Lure – Felice Picano*__\n__‘Explosive...Felice Picano is one hell of a writer’ Stephen King__ \nThe works of Felice Picano need little introduction. As one of the founding members of The Violet Quill, the foremost post-Stonewall gay writing movement, (other members included Edmund White and Andrew Holleran), Picano has published many acclaimed works of both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nFirst published in 1979, ‘The Lure’ rocketed Picano to commercial literary fame. With its nail-biting plot, and masterful suspense this gay thriller has lost none of its razor’s edge today and its depiction of the underground New York scene has never been more timely as TV series’ such as *The Deuce*, and *Pose* re-visit the 1970’s and 80’s.\n\n9781916129221 November 2019 bpb 198 x129 mm £8.99\n\n### __*Children of the Sun – Max Schaefer*__\n__‘Had me hooked from the first page to the last’ David Peace__\n1970: Fourteen-year-old Tony becomes seduced by the skinhead movement, sucked into a world of brutal racist violence and bizarre ritual.

At a loose end, he begins to research the far right in Britain and its secret gay membership. The two narrative threads of this extraordinarily assured and ambitious first novel unforgettably intersect ...\n\n*Children of the Sun* is a work of great imaginative sympathy and range - a novel of unblinking honesty but also of deep feeling, which illuminates the surprisingly thin line that separates aggression from tenderness and offers us a picture of a Britain that is strange and yet utterly convincing.\n\nSBN tbc May 2020 bpb 198 x 129 mm\n\n__For further information please contact Fiona Brownlee fiona@brownleedonald.com__","news":true,"date":"2019-08-15","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"6Zbq706RDxMp730XSsomzQ","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-08-15T16:39:07.719Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-15T16:39:07.719Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"LGBTQI logo","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/6Zbq706RDxMp730XSsomzQ/af4d697f32a464355c8dd47238431529/LGBT_logo.jpg","details":{"size":58150,"image":{"width":1080,"height":1080}},"fileName":"LGBT logo.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3Y5GwVM32jPtX9kAghm4h9","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-06-07T09:58:08.206Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-15T18:10:28.534Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"book"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Livingstone’s London","releaseDate":"2019-06-06T00:00+01:00","bookEdition":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"4nKffZN6aO7y66xr1KWy4M","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-06-07T09:57:16.814Z","updatedAt":"2019-06-07T12:23:31.340Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Livingstone’s London Paperback","format":"Paperback","isbn":"9781999613570","price":"£8.99","dimensions":"198 x 129mm","pageCount":"180 pp","amazonProductCode":"1999613570"}}],"blurb":"As a passionate Londoner, Ken Livingstone has seen London change dramatically over the last 60 years.

One of the finest historical novels in recent years’ - National Post\n\n\nFrom the winner of the Governor General’s Literary Prize,  a Walter Scott Prize Academy recommended read.\n\nAn extraordinary, epic novel with echoes of The Underground Railroad and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer.\n\nSpring 1855 and Virginian farmer John Dickinson has a dangerous secret that will have epic consequences. His reckless brother has squandered the family’s wealth and now a Canadian abolitionist has provoked their slaves with talk of liberation. The farm is in turmoil and then one of the workers makes a run for freedom. \n\nEscaping their financial losses, the family become fugitives of another kind.  Heading west by wagon in search of a new life, they are confronted by hunger, fear and a near-fatal riverboat accident.  Each member of the family is tested to the limit as they come to terms with their slave-owning past as the Civil War approaches. \n \nRich in character and incident, this is an extraordinary, epic and rewarding novel.  \n\nLinda Spalding is the author of four critically acclaimed novels, The Purchase, (awarded Canada’s Governor General’s Literary Award), Daughters of Captain Cook, The Paper Wife, and Mere.  She runs the Canadian literary magazine, Brick. She lives in Toronto. \n\n","shorterBlurb":"'One of the finest historical novels in recent years.’ National

off the boat-train at Victoria that warm May afternoon… ‘__\n\nGrowing up in a strict religious family in the 1920s, Annie Lang is witness to disturbing events that no one will explain. Only the family dog may know the answers.\n\nSix years on, student Annie returns from France to find her beloved brother in a mental hospital and her ally, the Sunday school teacher, vanished without trace. With the help of her childhood diary, and sister Beatrice, Annie turns detective to unearth the truth.\n\n__Her journey leads to a discovery so disturbing that she believes it will ruin all their lives, unless they can atone for the past.__\n\nRos Franey beautifully captures that point when a child can sense, and indeed dissent against, secrets that adults think they are too young to grasp. Impulsive, brave and lovable, Annie Lang is formidable when she takes matters into her own hands.","shorterBlurb":"‘A writer who has a genuine feel for her craft’  The Times","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"19ouRpMJBWEQAi6oSYMouK","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-13T13:21:18.037Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-26T16:34:22.487Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Ros Franey","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5W1WA83s40AwkAw6u8YYIC","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-13T13:21:11.677Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:21:11.677Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Ros Franey Profile Pic","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/5W1WA83s40AwkAw6u8YYIC/b837c0f31426de89028ae9e3cf9ed9f8/Ros_Franey.jpeg","details":{"size":50799,"image":{"width":466,"height":640}},"fileName":"Ros Franey.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"biography":"Ros Franey grew up in Nottingham where this book is set.

Extraordinary’ - Madeleine Thien, author of Do Not Say We Have Nothing \n\n‘Engrossing. One of the finest historical novels in recent years’ - National Post\n\n\nFrom the winner of the Governor General’s Literary Prize,  a Walter Scott Prize Academy recommended read.\n\nAn extraordinary, epic novel with echoes of The Underground Railroad and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer.\n\nSpring 1855 and Virginian farmer John Dickinson has a dangerous secret that will have epic consequences. His reckless brother has squandered the family’s wealth and now a Canadian abolitionist has provoked their slaves with talk of liberation. The farm is in turmoil and then one of the workers makes a run for freedom. \n\nEscaping their financial losses, the family become fugitives of another kind.  Heading west by wagon in search of a new life, they are confronted by hunger, fear and a near-fatal riverboat accident.  Each member of the family is tested to the limit as they come to terms with their slave-owning past as the Civil War approaches. \n \nRich in character and incident, this is an extraordinary, epic and rewarding novel.  \n\nLinda Spalding is the author of four critically acclaimed novels, The Purchase, (awarded Canada’s Governor General’s Literary Award), Daughters of Captain Cook, The Paper Wife, and Mere.  She runs the Canadian literary magazine, Brick. She lives in Toronto. \n\n","shorterBlurb":"'One of the finest historical novels in recent years.’ National

The 19 haunting and subtle stories in this anthology come from author Heidi Amsinck who, although born in Copenhagen, writes fluidly and artfully in English. This makes her writing refreshingly accessible for an international audience – although you’re never in any doubt that these tales take place in the slightly strange Scandinavian landscape, whether the setting is an urban art gallery, a woodland on the edge of the wilderness, a run-down antique shop, or the untouched-by-time, end of the railway line.\n\nSome of the stories explore undeniably supernatural themes, but most are firmly grounded in the base desires of human nature. Charlatans and conmen get their comeuppance in these urban fables which lean more towards gothic horror than the traditional fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen. The ‘horror’ is all achieved by suggestion and implication – and many of the stories are shot through with humour as dark as deadly nightshade. There’s frequently a sense of glee in how things transpire, when the tables are turned and the potential exploiter finds himself undone. Amsinck stands up for the under-dogs, the victims, the people who’ve been cheated or who’ve simply been abandoned and ignored by society.\n\nSeveral of the tales explore the theme of escape, of simply walking away from modern society, from an over-crowded life full of white noise and broken dreams. Wish-fulfilment? Maybe. Some of the stories edge into the uncanny and are genuinely unsettling; others are simply sad. None of them is particularly long, although there’s hidden depths between these brief pages.\n\nAs can often be the way with multiple stories from one author, it’s best to read each tale on its own, with space for the scenario to flourish in its own right. Read a whole bunch of them too quickly, too close together, and they lose their identities and will merge into an amorphous muddle. This is a collection to be savoured, slowly, on cold nights when the wind is howling and you can imagine the ice forming in the corners of a disturbed soul.\n\n__8/10__\n\nReviewed by _Rowena Hoseason_\n\nFind out more about Last Train to Helsingoør [here](http://www.muswell-press.co.uk/book/the-last-train-to-helsingor).","news":true,"date":"2018-03-02","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"74yzmb33gIq0iiUO0Su0WQ","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-03-05T13:21:40.506Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-05T13:29:30.499Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"image001-1","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/74yzmb33gIq0iiUO0Su0WQ/09689c4f8b19e5b07b64ce6d502e5880/cropped-mmm-wp171.jpg","details":{"size":35527,"image":{"width":601,"height":150}},"fileName":"cropped-mmm-wp171.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1YDQhxh332ymmy2eqiyS8O","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-02-26T14:09:56.908Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-26T14:09:56.908Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Last Train to Helsingør Book Launch","content":"Celebrating the launch of Last Train to Helsingør by Heidi Amsinck at Daunt Books, Cheapside, London, with actor Tim McInnerny who gave a brilliant, creepy reading.","news":true,"date":"2018-02-21","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1rq9dEjM0s602mSq6E4OWo","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-02-26T14:09:13.819Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-26T14:09:13.819Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Heidi and Tim McInnerny","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/1rq9dEjM0s602mSq6E4OWo/f3b4258cd3a39566b55c55d0e05ada44/IMG_6228.JPG","details":{"size":172293,"image":{"width":480,"height":640}},"fileName":"IMG_6228.JPG","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"Z5loCbJo8EEIAuu6CygEq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-02-16T11:00:35.731Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-05T13:17:44.843Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"The chanterelles of Østvig","author":"TripFiction","content":"## Nordic Noir: short stories set in Denmark, and chatting to the author about Copenhagen\n\n__Read the original article [here](https://www.tripfiction.com/nordic-noir-short-stories-set-denmark-chatting-author-copenhagen/).__\n\nLast Train to Helsingør is the eponymous title of the first story in this slim volume, full of duplicitous perpetrators and situations with underlying menace.\n\nMany are set in Copenhagen, but some are set beyond the capital, on the train to Helsingør, or Brokholm further North, for example.\n\nConniving elderly women will surely hook their victim in, the lure of an ancient Chinese vase too much for one antique dealer.

The thought of them growing unnoticed in the forest after her death was unbearable. \n\nShe pushed back the covers and sat up in bed, wincing at the pain. It was everywhere now, not just in her chest. Her breaths were wheezy and ineffective, her lungs like perforated bellows.\n\nThrough the open window, she could hear the eternal sigh of the north sea. The dawn air was damp and fragrant with rose hip and wet grass. No wind stirred the net curtains. \n\nShe snatched a whining mosquito out of the air and squashed its quivering limbs between her fingers before setting two feet on the cold floor. \n                                                                                      \nFive generations of Holms had picked chanterelles in the great sand-dune plantations. She was the last of the line, the only person living to know where the chanterelles of Østvig grew. unless she told someone. \n\nA stench of spoiled fish greeted her in the kitchen, last night's cod. in the end, she had not had the appetite for it. She emptied the pan outside by the woodpile, something would eat the fish - foxes, rats, gulls. \n\nLike her body when they finally put her in the ground, the cod would be reclaimed by nature, nothing was wasted in the end. Even her own flesh would make a feast, if only for maggots. \n\nShe looked out over the dunes, followed a V-formation of migrating geese pulling across the flat expanse of lyme grass and heather. The sky was bigger here than elsewhere in Denmark. The deep blue light cast a primeval glow on the landscape, as though it had never been morning there before. she licked her lips and tasted salt. \n\nThe vicar picked up on the seventh ring, his voice thick with sleep. 'Gudrun. You are up early.' \n\n'Vicar, I'm dying,' she said, brushing off his noises of sympathy. 'But that's not why I'm calling.' \n\n'No?' \n\nShe pictured the vicar squinting beneath his great domed forehead, his hand crabbing across the bedside table as he searched for his glasses. She stemmed her impatience at his dithering. After all, he had known her as a child and would, by long-standing agreement, be the one laying her to rest in a few short weeks. There would be no mourners. \n\n'I wish to pass something on to you,' she said. 'it's about the chanterelles. I want to tell you where to find them.' she allowed a pause for the vicar's reaction. It wasn't much. \n\n'Oh,' he said. 'Oh, I see.' \n\n'Well?' she said. 'Will you come with me today, so I can show you?' \n\nWhen the vicar cleared his throat, she could tell that he was about to disappoint her. \n\n'I'm old, Gudrun, and won't be long after you in Heaven. You don't want to trust me with something so important,' he said. \n\n'But you're the only person I know,' she protested. \n\nThe vicar did not bother to contradict her, everyone knew that Gudrun Holm disliked people. \n\nThere was a moment's pause before he spoke again. 'Then there is only one other option.' \n\n'What?' Gudrun asked suspiciously. \n\n'It's obvious,' he said. 'it has to be someone you are yet to meet.' \n\nshe rang off. \n\n'Easy for you,' she spat, her voice echoing in the empty house. 'You forget this isn't exactly Copenhagen central station.' \nShe sharpened her mushroom knife standing by the sink soothed by the feel of its pear-shaped wooden handle in the palm of her hand. The kitchen window was greasy with sea fret, no matter how often she washed her windows, the sea always won. \n\nAfter drying it carefully, she wrapped the knife in a dishcloth and placed it in the faded wicker basket that was older than herself. Then she slipped a worn tracksuit top over her T-shirt, found her battered leather walking boots and tied a multi-coloured scarf over the itchy stubble on her scalp. \n\nThe bones in her buttocks grated against the saddle as she cycled slowly up the dirt track. How many more days would she be able to do this before the rest of her strength ebbed away? Two? Three? \n\nWhen she reached the main road, she looked to the left where the village houses lay like a jumble of Lego bricks on the horizon. \n\nA car passed, a sleek black number with German plates. Østvig was not what it used to be, not since they had knocked up all those new holiday homes. Once there had been fourteen sky-blue boats fishing the north sea from the village, a grocery shop, even a school. now all the fishermen had cleared off, and Østvig had become a hollowed-out shell, overrun with tourists from May to October. \n\nSomeone had placed a sandwich board close to her drive. Straight on for ice cream. She got off her bike and kicked the sign into a rose bush, then had to hobble for a minute, holding her sore foot. \n\nThe road was empty but for a small local boy who stopped and stared at her, mouth agape, fish eyes frowning. 'What are you looking at?' she scowled, shaking her fist. When the boy had gone, she turned right onto the main road and, after about five minutes, headed down the gravel track that cut like a ruler through the pine plantation. The sound of the ocean was more muted here, like a distant exhalation. A wood pigeon called nearby. The air was sweet and mild and buzzing with insects. Gudrun allowed herself a moment of self-pity that this place should be lost to her, and so soon. Sweeping flies away from her face, she rested her bike against a silver birch and concealed it with bracken.\n\nFor as long as she could remember, she had been the guardian of the chanterelles, and what was to become of them without her? Who now would bear witness to their beauty? Her father had shown her the almost invisible deer paths that criss-crossed these woods, pointing to the mould- coloured lichen, oak saplings and thick green moss that the chanterelles favoured. They grew low, partly covered by vegetation, like gold coins scattered on the weedy bottom of a lake. \n\nShe came to a sandy hollow, dappled with sunlight. it was one of her most reliable patches, and it took her only a few minutes to find the first chanterelle. The sight of the little golden disc made her heart leap, as though it had revealed itself especially for her. \n\nShe knelt down with flies circling her head and slid two fingers around the chanterelle. it was cool under the moss. The knife sliced easily through the stem. \n\nLike an offering to the gods, she held the pale orange trumpet up to the light, closed her eyes and inhaled its scent of wet stone and old, sweet apples. \n\nA noise close by startled her. she dropped the mush- room. someone was laughing in disbelief, the laughter punctured by little gasps and screams. \n\n'Nej, nej, nej, nej,' said a male voice. \n\nGudrun moved towards the sound, keeping her feet on the thick, slippery moss that silenced her steps, and taking care not to snap any twigs or branches. Her heart beat sickeningly fast. \n\nSomething red showed between the trees: an anorak. It bobbed up and down as the stranger darted to and fro, bending and standing. \n\nAnd there was something else: the forest floor was virtually shimmering with gold, even from where Gudrun was squatting behind a stunted pine, it was obvious that there were hundreds, perhaps thousands, of chanterelles in there. \n\nShe must have made a sound after all, because the man suddenly raised his head and swivelled around to look right at her. \nHe was young enough to have been her son, perhaps in his late thirties. His chubby cheeks were plum-coloured with excitement, his long, greying hair tousled and wild. \n\n'Hej,' he said. Just like that, as though they were old friends. \n\nThis had a disarming effect on Gudrun. she felt herself softening towards him. \n\n'This is unbelievable, so many. come.' He waved. 'come and see.' \n\nShe didn't want to, but something pulled her forward, as if by a rope tied around her waist. \n\nAs she pushed through the branches, she wondered if she was dreaming. if maybe the painkillers they had given her yesterday at the hospital were causing her to hallucinate. \n\nHer eyes took in a rucksack, tossed aside in a patch of bare sand and next to it a clipboard with a few crumpled sheets of paper on it. The man looked at her warmly. 'I see you have the tools of the trade,' he said, nodding at her basket. 'A fellow mushroom hunter.' \n\nShe opened and closed her mouth like a cod, silenced by his forward manner. \n\n'Do you live locally?' he asked. she nodded feebly. 'Then, if you don't mind,' he said, picking up the clipboard and taking down a pencil from behind his ear 'could you tell me where else I might find chanterelles in this plantation?' \n\nGudrun noticed with alarm that the papers attached to the clipboard were photocopies of small-scale maps. \n\n'No, no, it's not like that,' the man said. 'I won't be picking them. it's purely for scientific purposes - Aalborg University.' He fished an id card out of his pocket. \n\nGudrun stared at it, marvelling at the barefaced cheek of this Torben Larsen, Research Scientist, Department of Chemistry and Bioscience. she was still too astounded to speak. \n\nShe gave back the id card and noticed that Torben Larsen hadn't yet picked any chanterelles but instead filled two tiny specimen containers with moss and sand. \n\n'Perhaps it's easier if you look at the map,' he said, handing her the clipboard. 'it's local people like you who make all the difference. no amount of years in a laboratory could replace what you know.' \n\nGudrun thought of what the vicar had said earlier. Was this the sort of stranger he had had in mind? \n\n'Are you fond of chanterelles?' she managed to stutter. \n\n'Oh, yes,' he said. 'my parents used to take me hunting for them. That's what kicked all this off.' \n\n'All this?' said Gudrun. \n\n'I'm trying to pinpoint the conditions in which chanterelles thrive. The exact type of soil they need, the required species of surrounding vegetation and so on. The more sites like this that i am able to study, the more I will know.' \n\nShe squinted at him. Torben Larsen had his back to the sunlight. it made his protruding ears look a luminous red, almost transparent. \n\n'You used the word \"exact\",' she said. 'Of course, you must already know that there is no such thing as exact when it comes to chanterelles. They are free-spirited little things.' \n\n'Fantastic.' He rushed over to the rucksack and retrieved a notebook. 'The way you just put that.' He repeated it to himself as he wrote: 'Free-spirited little things.' \n\nGudrun meanwhile looked at the map, easily picking out the main road and the neat grid of tracks on either side of it. Torben Larsen came back and passed her the pencil. 'You can outline the patches with this, if you like.' \n\nShe shook her head vigorously. 'No maps. nothing must ever be committed to paper.' \n\n'Right you are,' Torben Larsen said, tapping the side of his nose. 'Good point, um . . .' \n\n'Gudrun Holm.' \n\n'Good point, Mrs Holm. You never know what hands such information might fall into.' \n\nShe looked up at him. 'Precisely, and it's Miss Holm,' she said, before making a momentous decision. \n\nShe took a deep breath. 'But I could point them out to you, if you like?' \n\nFor a moment, she considered confiding in him that she was dying, but something stopped her, something that had been niggling away at the back of her mind, a question. \n\n'Before I do,' she said. 'Tell me, why do you need to know so much?' \n\nTorben Larsen looked sheepish and excited at the same time. He lowered his voice. 'I wasn't going to say anything, but I think I can trust you. One secret deserves another, right?' \n\n'Trust me with what?' Gudrun said, narrowing her eyes. \n\nHe held up his thumb and index finger, a centimetre apart. 'I'm about this close to a huge breakthrough, Miss Holm, something that has eluded scientists for years.' \n\nHe bent down and carefully picked a chanterelle. \n\n'Soon,' he said. 'Beauties like this will be cultivated in greenhouses and poly-tunnels all over the world, thanks to what I've discovered.' \n\nThe clipboard became butter in Gudrun's hands, sliding out of her grip and landing on a heap of pinecones. Her nausea returned. she waved her hands helplessly in front of her chest. \n\n'They will be on the menu of every restaurant and on everybody's lips. They will conquer the world,' Torben Larsen said, blind to her distress. \n\nGudrun found her voice. it was whinging and weak. 'But it's impossible,' she said. 'People have tried, of course, but chanterelles are too fussy, it will never take off.' \n\n'Oh yes it will. I'm almost certain I have found a way to mimic the symbiotic relationship between these fungi and tree roots under laboratory conditions,' Torben Larsen said, his eyes shining with a strange, brilliant light. \n\nHe slapped Gudrun's back, almost causing her to fall forward. she gasped for air, hands on her knees, swallowing bile. \n\n'I'm talking about mass production, Miss Holm, a brand new reliable food source. You will not need to pick these mushrooms ever again. You will be able to buy them in your local supermarket - fresh, tinned, frozen, freeze- dried, you name it, isn't it great?' \n\nHe laughed, mistaking her horror for amazement, her disgust for mock disbelief. \n\n'Stop,' she said, pressing her hands to her ears. 'in God's name, stop.' \n\nShe looked wildly around the clearing. it had started to spin before her eyes, like a gold and green wheel. But Torben Larsen kept on laughing as though he had said the funniest thing. \n\nHis mouth was full of dark fillings, she saw now, and his nails were bitten right down to the peeling, bleeding skin. There were nicotine stains on the fingers of his right hand. \n\nHer beautiful chanterelles. Torben Larsen would take them and rob them of their rarity, the very thing that made them special. The secret of the Holms would be of less consequence than a gull's feather in a north sea storm. \n\nA purple dusk fell over her eyes. she gripped the mush- room knife in her pocket so tightly that it felt as though her veins would burst. \n\n'You stupid, stupid man!' she screamed. \n\nTorben Larsen fell heavily, still with a self-congratulatory smile on his lips. He clutched his anorak and looked down in surprise at the beetroot stain spreading across his chest. Then his eyes rolled back, starting unseeingly at the summer sky, while a bluebottle crawled across his face. \n\nGudrun pulled back the knife. There was a lot of blood. she wiped her boots on the bracken and buried her jumper in the sodden ground with Torben Larsen's rucksack and papers. nature would take care of his body. Not many people crossed the woods at Østvig, and by the time he was found, if ever, she would be long dead herself. \n\nIt was only when she neared the house that her legs began to tremble on the bike. The sun beat down on the tarmac and pearls of sweat ran down the back of her neck. It was windier now and the sea was up, getting noisier as she shortened the distance between herself and the beach. \n\nWhen she got home, she would have a bath, then get under the cool covers of her bed, close her eyes and never rise again. 'But what about the chanterelles?' a little voice inside her insisted. 'What will it all have been for, if you don't tell anyone about them now?'\n\nThe local boy from earlier was back, poking the lyme grass with a stick as though trying to spike fish. she slowed down and looked at him more closely. There was something singular and wilful about him, something that reminded Gudrun of herself. Again, the vicar's words came back to her. \n\nShe stopped and got off the bike. 'You there,' she cooed to him. The boy looked up, his concentrated expression contorting into one of terror and alarm. He threw down his stick and hunched his shoulders. \n\n'Don't be frightened,' she said, wheeling the bike over to where he stood. 'I won't shout at you this time.' \n\nThe boy looked unconvinced. He was trembling, his dirty little hands balled into fists, his wide eyes fixed on a streak of blood on her thigh. \n\n'It's nothing.  I scratched myself on a branch. But listen to this,' she said. 'There is something I want to tell you, a secret.' \n\nThe boy looked at her warily, but she could tell that he was interested. no child had ever been born who didn't like a secret. \n\n'It's a good secret,' she said. 'The sort that people would do anything to steal from you, but you won't let them. You will defend this secret with your life, even kill for it if you have to.' \n\n'Come,' she said and made him sit down with her on a large white boulder by the side of the road. it was smooth and warm. she felt a great sense of peace spreading through her body. \n\n'Now,' she said, very quietly, though only the crickets and adders and skylarks were around to hear them. \n\n'Do you know what a chanterelle is?'

The golden, trumpet-shaped mushrooms grow wild in the great dune plantations of Denmark's far north, and every year we get together in a wooden cabin to hunt for them. \n\n![fullsizeoutput 128b[6][2][4]](//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/4FG1JwPn96Ey0G6WiE84Si/0fc94576538b27b37eb9894faa956e1b/fullsizeoutput_128b_6__2__4_.jpeg)\n\nMy late father, Finn, could walk the seemingly endless forest trails with his eyes closed. He knew where the chanterelles grew, but refused to commit his knowledge to paper, and taught us kids how to hide our tracks and put other mushroom hunters off the scent. The elusiveness of chanterelles appealed to his independent and wilful spirit, as did the fact that they cannot be cultivated. \n\nBut what if someone worked out how to farm them? What if chanterelles became as common as any other mushroom, and a butter-sautéed feast of them could be had any day of the week? And, if a lover of chanterelles - such as my father - got the chance to stop this from happening, what would they do?\n\nYou'll have to read the story to find out for yourself, but let's just say that in the depths of the Danish pine forests, no one can hear you scream.\n\nIn my story, the protagonist is loosely based on an eccentric woman who lives locally to our cabin by the beach. Østvig could any one of dozens of quiet fishing villages, lining the rough North Sea coast.\n\nI lost my beloved father, but kept his secret. I, too, know where the chanterelles grow. To this day, walking through the secluded woods, pushing through dense branches on a carpet of moss and coming across a hollow shimmering with golden fungi, remains one of my greatest pleasures.\n\nIf you have never tried chanterelle hunting, I urge you to give it a go. But if you meet an old woman out there, with a woven basket and a mushroom knife, you might want to run in the other direction.\n\n![IMG 2298](//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/2kQlF3RMAQAwmMU8G2giqQ/b23913acaef2d81f8c7f4820ed409cd3/IMG_2298.jpeg) \n\nFind out more about visiting Denmark [here](https://www.visitdenmark.co.uk/en-gb/denmark/discover-denmark-exciting-city-breaks-and-stunning-nature).","news":true,"date":"2018-02-08","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"27OJSFJomkuE0684IIkSKu","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-02-08T17:08:01.371Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-08T17:08:01.371Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Murder in the Woods","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/27OJSFJomkuE0684IIkSKu/d485aba5f3f5800b5e51baebd21b53d0/IMG_4379.jpeg","details":{"size":81713,"image":{"width":640,"height":248}},"fileName":"IMG_4379.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"43jf1fG3FuIkAcoqWcSuYc","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-31T15:10:01.428Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-05T13:27:47.215Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Daily Mail review of Last Train","text":"A nice slice of creepy Scandi-noir","author":"Daily Mail","date":"2018-02-01"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3U4twzdIZOqYIAkcoWKigk","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-02-28T14:44:17.572Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-05T13:13:14.957Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"MurderMayhem&More's Recommends Last Train to Helsingør","author":"MurderMayhem&More","content":"[MurderMayhem&More](https://murdermayhemandmore.wordpress.com/2018/01/26/crime-time-new-books-and-recommended-reads-5/) recently reviewed Last Train to Helsingør:\n\n### Crime Time: new books and recommended reads\n\n#### _LAST TRAIN TO HELSINGØR by Heidi Amsinck_\n\n_This Danish author is unusual in that she writes in English, exploring the shadows of Scandinavian society in a series of short stories. This collection of darkly chilling but entertaining tales ranges from the commuter who bitterly regrets falling asleep on a late-night train, to the mushroom hunter prepared to kill to guard her secret. Copenhagen becomes a city of twilight and shadows, as canny antique dealers and property sharks get their comeuppance at the hands of old ladies, and ghosts act in most peculiar ways. You may recognise some of the stories which have been dramatised for radio – they’re the perfect introduction to Nordic noir if you’ve wondered what all the fuss is about._\n\nSee their other recommendations [here](https://murdermayhemandmore.wordpress.com/2018/01/26/crime-time-new-books-and-recommended-reads-5/).","news":true,"date":"2018-02-28","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"2LyqEBXErKA64GQ8u8OEsu","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-02-28T14:44:14.554Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-28T14:44:14.554Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"crimescene-header","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/2LyqEBXErKA64GQ8u8OEsu/989e158385adbfb71a7b47f89b9cea44/crimescene-header.jpg","details":{"size":129173,"image":{"width":1400,"height":623}},"fileName":"crimescene-header.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"4k5qoizHm0g06sM8Q4k6A2","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-03-07T11:12:20.809Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-07T11:12:20.809Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Last Train to Helsingør reviews on Goodreads","author":"Blair, Goodreads","content":"The title story, which opens the collection, is as though Jeremy de Quidt's *'The Wrong Train'* has been rewritten for adults by someone who's recently read Robert Aickman's 'The Hospice'. It's a promising start, and many of the other tales live up to it. *'The Music Box'* is a cautionary tale of a collector's lust for a cursed object; 'The Tallboy' spins an equally enjoyable scene around a similar premise. *'The Light from Dead Stars'* is a crime story in which a police inspector, about to retire, is handed an unexpected clue to a a cold case that has long tortured him. *'The Bird in the Cage'* is a nasty little fable like something out of Grimm. I loved the ghost stories *'The Man Upstairs'*, about an unseen neighbour and a 'ghastly' face at a window; *'The Night Guard'*, in which a man finds himself trapped in his favourite art gallery after closing time; *'The Crying'*, a very dark story in which an immoral and deceptive protagonist gets his comeuppance; *'Room Service'*, the tale of an inept chef and a strange request, which might have been my favourite. The weakest stories were a little too twee for my tastes: I wasn't keen on *'Like White Rain'*, *'The Ghost of Helene Jørgensen'* and especially the rather smug *'Detained'* for this reason. All in all, however, this is a really strong collection of noir and ghost stories with fantastic pacing and atmosphere. One to settle down with and read in a single sitting on a rainy afternoon or cold night.\n\n__4/5 stars__\n\nYou can read the original review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2196629414)","news":true,"date":"2018-03-07","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"NFJuX13QwmwMUUqmSyOq8","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-03-07T11:11:41.278Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-07T11:11:41.278Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Screen Shot 2018-03-07 at 11.10.05","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/NFJuX13QwmwMUUqmSyOq8/3b517b2d24fe66277aaf969ffee67e0a/Screen_Shot_2018-03-07_at_11.10.05.png","details":{"size":485473,"image":{"width":1432,"height":746}},"fileName":"Screen Shot 2018-03-07 at 11.10.05.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3YdkO6Bcf6AeMoEaqS8Kay","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-12T11:32:35.354Z","updatedAt":"2018-04-12T11:32:35.354Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"The Last Train to Helsingør now No. 3 at WHSmith Travel","content":"We're excited to see that the Last Train to Helsingør is now No. 3 at [WHSmith](https://www.whsmith.co.uk/products/last-train-to-helsingor-danish-noir/9780995482241) Travel.

Not to mention, Burt the Satanic dog who truly has it in for his master.   \n\nFeaturing colourful characters, a stunning location, and an inspiring collection of beer recipes, this is an irresistible feast of humour and heart.","shorterBlurb":"One family’s quest to brew British beer in the heart of French wine country – funny, endearing and sometimes just plain surreal.","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5bgDNxItHO6gaG88m6YSEW","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-06-07T12:31:31.599Z","updatedAt":"2018-06-07T12:31:31.599Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Tommy Barnes","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5CR2aPtFAIE8muumOYo0ug","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-06-07T12:30:15.819Z","updatedAt":"2018-06-07T12:30:46.123Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Tommy Barnes","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/5CR2aPtFAIE8muumOYo0ug/aa9a8d6dda42dd724fb9e7ae378f4982/IMG_7067.jpg","details":{"size":1287764,"image":{"width":3104,"height":1764}},"fileName":"IMG_7067.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"brief":"Tommy's first book, A Beer in the Loire, is the account of his calamitous attempt to set up a microbrewery in French wine country.","biography":"Tommy Barnes was raised on the gritty streets of Letchworth Garden City, home of the first traffic roundabout.

Sarah Addleshaw – young, spirited and keen to prove her worth – begins term as the first female academic at her college. She is, in fact, its only female ‘Fellow’. \n\nImpulsive love affairs – with people, places and the ideas in her head – beset Sarah throughout her first exhilarating year as a don, but it is the Reading Party that has the most dramatic impact. \n\nAsked to accompany the first mixed group of students on the annual retreat in Cornwall, Sarah finds herself illicitly drawn to one of them, the suave American Tyler. Torn between professional integrity and personal feelings, she faces her biggest challenge to date.\n\nA fresh view of Oxford, seen through the eyes of a young woman historian appointed to a male college in 1976, who tells her own story with wit and feeling in this original and charming novel.","shorterBlurb":"A fresh view of Oxford, seen through the eyes of a young woman historian appointed to a male college in 1976, who tells her own story with wit and feeling in this original and charming novel.","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"4YioM51UaAGAgSkE4A8oyC","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-02-26T14:17:48.054Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-11T16:06:11.155Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Fenella Gentleman","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"2U2lzhJFjOKO8W88Wo6Ek2","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-05-03T12:16:05.126Z","updatedAt":"2018-05-03T12:16:05.126Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Fenella Gentleman 4#1D60D02","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/2U2lzhJFjOKO8W88Wo6Ek2/9cee6f4e54189e18861366c37e77f67c/Fenella_Gentleman_4_1D60D02.jpg","details":{"size":3111437,"image":{"width":4366,"height":3492}},"fileName":"Fenella_Gentleman_4#1D60D02.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"biography":"Fenella Gentleman studied PPE at Wadham College, Oxford, when it went mixed.

Only the family dog may know the answers.\n\nSix years on, student Annie returns from France to find her beloved brother in a mental hospital and her ally, the Sunday school teacher, vanished without trace. With the help of her childhood diary, and sister Beatrice, Annie turns detective to unearth the truth.\n\n__Her journey leads to a discovery so disturbing that she believes it will ruin all their lives, unless they can atone for the past.__\n\nRos Franey beautifully captures that point when a child can sense, and indeed dissent against, secrets that adults think they are too young to grasp.

It's a promising start, and many of the other tales live up to it. *'The Music Box'* is a cautionary tale of a collector's lust for a cursed object; 'The Tallboy' spins an equally enjoyable scene around a similar premise. *'The Light from Dead Stars'* is a crime story in which a police inspector, about to retire, is handed an unexpected clue to a a cold case that has long tortured him. *'The Bird in the Cage'* is a nasty little fable like something out of Grimm. I loved the ghost stories *'The Man Upstairs'*, about an unseen neighbour and a 'ghastly' face at a window; *'The Night Guard'*, in which a man finds himself trapped in his favourite art gallery after closing time; *'The Crying'*, a very dark story in which an immoral and deceptive protagonist gets his comeuppance; *'Room Service'*, the tale of an inept chef and a strange request, which might have been my favourite. The weakest stories were a little too twee for my tastes: I wasn't keen on *'Like White Rain'*, *'The Ghost of Helene Jørgensen'* and especially the rather smug *'Detained'* for this reason. All in all, however, this is a really strong collection of noir and ghost stories with fantastic pacing and atmosphere. One to settle down with and read in a single sitting on a rainy afternoon or cold night.\n\n__4/5 stars__\n\nYou can read the original review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2196629414)","news":true,"date":"2018-03-07","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"NFJuX13QwmwMUUqmSyOq8","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-03-07T11:11:41.278Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-07T11:11:41.278Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Screen Shot 2018-03-07 at 11.10.05","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/NFJuX13QwmwMUUqmSyOq8/3b517b2d24fe66277aaf969ffee67e0a/Screen_Shot_2018-03-07_at_11.10.05.png","details":{"size":485473,"image":{"width":1432,"height":746}},"fileName":"Screen Shot 2018-03-07 at 11.10.05.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3djXFFzWvKyUeywUuyuAKg","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-02-08T17:08:15.983Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-05T22:01:47.494Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Murder in the Woods","author":"Visit Denmark","content":"__Heidi Amsinck tells us what inspired her to write The Chanterelles of Østvig from her Nordic Noir collection Last Train to Helsingør, out now from Muswell Press.__\n\nMy Danish family is obsessed with foraging for chanterelles.

He knew where the chanterelles grew, but refused to commit his knowledge to paper, and taught us kids how to hide our tracks and put other mushroom hunters off the scent. The elusiveness of chanterelles appealed to his independent and wilful spirit, as did the fact that they cannot be cultivated. \n\nBut what if someone worked out how to farm them?

To this day, walking through the secluded woods, pushing through dense branches on a carpet of moss and coming across a hollow shimmering with golden fungi, remains one of my greatest pleasures.\n\nIf you have never tried chanterelle hunting, I urge you to give it a go. But if you meet an old woman out there, with a woven basket and a mushroom knife, you might want to run in the other direction.\n\n![IMG 2298](//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/2kQlF3RMAQAwmMU8G2giqQ/b23913acaef2d81f8c7f4820ed409cd3/IMG_2298.jpeg) \n\nFind out more about visiting Denmark [here](https://www.visitdenmark.co.uk/en-gb/denmark/discover-denmark-exciting-city-breaks-and-stunning-nature).","news":true,"date":"2018-02-08","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"27OJSFJomkuE0684IIkSKu","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-02-08T17:08:01.371Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-08T17:08:01.371Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Murder in the Woods","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/27OJSFJomkuE0684IIkSKu/d485aba5f3f5800b5e51baebd21b53d0/IMG_4379.jpeg","details":{"size":81713,"image":{"width":640,"height":248}},"fileName":"IMG_4379.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"43jf1fG3FuIkAcoqWcSuYc","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-31T15:10:01.428Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-05T13:27:47.215Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Daily Mail review of Last Train","text":"A nice slice of creepy Scandi-noir","author":"Daily Mail","date":"2018-02-01"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5x6w0njCWAaeiKkyi4MSm4","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-03-05T13:25:00.253Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-05T13:25:00.253Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"MurderMayhem&More's Review of Last Train to Helsingør","author":"MurderMayhem&More","content":"Read to original review [here](https://murdermayhemandmore.wordpress.com/2018/03/02/last-train-to-helsingor-spooky-scandi-stories/).\n\n---\n\n## Last Train To Helsingør: spooky Scandi stories\n\nDeliciously delicate, these Danish short stories meander along the sinister side of twilight, weaving dark descriptions of despair, duplicity and justly-deserved retribution. The 19 haunting and subtle stories in this anthology come from author Heidi Amsinck who, although born in Copenhagen, writes fluidly and artfully in English. This makes her writing refreshingly accessible for an international audience – although you’re never in any doubt that these tales take place in the slightly strange Scandinavian landscape, whether the setting is an urban art gallery, a woodland on the edge of the wilderness, a run-down antique shop, or the untouched-by-time, end of the railway line.\n\nSome of the stories explore undeniably supernatural themes, but most are firmly grounded in the base desires of human nature. Charlatans and conmen get their comeuppance in these urban fables which lean more towards gothic horror than the traditional fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen. The ‘horror’ is all achieved by suggestion and implication – and many of the stories are shot through with humour as dark as deadly nightshade. There’s frequently a sense of glee in how things transpire, when the tables are turned and the potential exploiter finds himself undone. Amsinck stands up for the under-dogs, the victims, the people who’ve been cheated or who’ve simply been abandoned and ignored by society.\n\nSeveral of the tales explore the theme of escape, of simply walking away from modern society, from an over-crowded life full of white noise and broken dreams. Wish-fulfilment? Maybe. Some of the stories edge into the uncanny and are genuinely unsettling; others are simply sad. None of them is particularly long, although there’s hidden depths between these brief pages.\n\nAs can often be the way with multiple stories from one author, it’s best to read each tale on its own, with space for the scenario to flourish in its own right. Read a whole bunch of them too quickly, too close together, and they lose their identities and will merge into an amorphous muddle. This is a collection to be savoured, slowly, on cold nights when the wind is howling and you can imagine the ice forming in the corners of a disturbed soul.\n\n__8/10__\n\nReviewed by _Rowena Hoseason_\n\nFind out more about Last Train to Helsingoør [here](http://www.muswell-press.co.uk/book/the-last-train-to-helsingor).","news":true,"date":"2018-03-02","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"74yzmb33gIq0iiUO0Su0WQ","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-03-05T13:21:40.506Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-05T13:29:30.499Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"image001-1","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/74yzmb33gIq0iiUO0Su0WQ/09689c4f8b19e5b07b64ce6d502e5880/cropped-mmm-wp171.jpg","details":{"size":35527,"image":{"width":601,"height":150}},"fileName":"cropped-mmm-wp171.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"Z5loCbJo8EEIAuu6CygEq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-02-16T11:00:35.731Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-05T13:17:44.843Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"The chanterelles of Østvig","author":"TripFiction","content":"## Nordic Noir: short stories set in Denmark, and chatting to the author about Copenhagen\n\n__Read the original article [here](https://www.tripfiction.com/nordic-noir-short-stories-set-denmark-chatting-author-copenhagen/).__\n\nLast Train to Helsingør is the eponymous title of the first story in this slim volume, full of duplicitous perpetrators and situations with underlying menace.\n\nMany are set in Copenhagen, but some are set beyond the capital, on the train to Helsingør, or Brokholm further North, for example.\n\nConniving elderly women will surely hook their victim in, the lure of an ancient Chinese vase too much for one antique dealer.

The thought of them growing unnoticed in the forest after her death was unbearable. \n\nShe pushed back the covers and sat up in bed, wincing at the pain. It was everywhere now, not just in her chest. Her breaths were wheezy and ineffective, her lungs like perforated bellows.\n\nThrough the open window, she could hear the eternal sigh of the north sea. The dawn air was damp and fragrant with rose hip and wet grass. No wind stirred the net curtains. \n\nShe snatched a whining mosquito out of the air and squashed its quivering limbs between her fingers before setting two feet on the cold floor. \n                                                                                      \nFive generations of Holms had picked chanterelles in the great sand-dune plantations. She was the last of the line, the only person living to know where the chanterelles of Østvig grew. unless she told someone. \n\nA stench of spoiled fish greeted her in the kitchen, last night's cod. in the end, she had not had the appetite for it. She emptied the pan outside by the woodpile, something would eat the fish - foxes, rats, gulls. \n\nLike her body when they finally put her in the ground, the cod would be reclaimed by nature, nothing was wasted in the end. Even her own flesh would make a feast, if only for maggots. \n\nShe looked out over the dunes, followed a V-formation of migrating geese pulling across the flat expanse of lyme grass and heather. The sky was bigger here than elsewhere in Denmark. The deep blue light cast a primeval glow on the landscape, as though it had never been morning there before. she licked her lips and tasted salt. \n\nThe vicar picked up on the seventh ring, his voice thick with sleep. 'Gudrun. You are up early.' \n\n'Vicar, I'm dying,' she said, brushing off his noises of sympathy. 'But that's not why I'm calling.' \n\n'No?' \n\nShe pictured the vicar squinting beneath his great domed forehead, his hand crabbing across the bedside table as he searched for his glasses. She stemmed her impatience at his dithering. After all, he had known her as a child and would, by long-standing agreement, be the one laying her to rest in a few short weeks. There would be no mourners. \n\n'I wish to pass something on to you,' she said. 'it's about the chanterelles. I want to tell you where to find them.' she allowed a pause for the vicar's reaction. It wasn't much. \n\n'Oh,' he said. 'Oh, I see.' \n\n'Well?' she said. 'Will you come with me today, so I can show you?' \n\nWhen the vicar cleared his throat, she could tell that he was about to disappoint her. \n\n'I'm old, Gudrun, and won't be long after you in Heaven. You don't want to trust me with something so important,' he said. \n\n'But you're the only person I know,' she protested. \n\nThe vicar did not bother to contradict her, everyone knew that Gudrun Holm disliked people. \n\nThere was a moment's pause before he spoke again. 'Then there is only one other option.' \n\n'What?' Gudrun asked suspiciously. \n\n'It's obvious,' he said. 'it has to be someone you are yet to meet.' \n\nshe rang off. \n\n'Easy for you,' she spat, her voice echoing in the empty house. 'You forget this isn't exactly Copenhagen central station.' \nShe sharpened her mushroom knife standing by the sink soothed by the feel of its pear-shaped wooden handle in the palm of her hand. The kitchen window was greasy with sea fret, no matter how often she washed her windows, the sea always won. \n\nAfter drying it carefully, she wrapped the knife in a dishcloth and placed it in the faded wicker basket that was older than herself. Then she slipped a worn tracksuit top over her T-shirt, found her battered leather walking boots and tied a multi-coloured scarf over the itchy stubble on her scalp. \n\nThe bones in her buttocks grated against the saddle as she cycled slowly up the dirt track. How many more days would she be able to do this before the rest of her strength ebbed away? Two? Three? \n\nWhen she reached the main road, she looked to the left where the village houses lay like a jumble of Lego bricks on the horizon. \n\nA car passed, a sleek black number with German plates. Østvig was not what it used to be, not since they had knocked up all those new holiday homes. Once there had been fourteen sky-blue boats fishing the north sea from the village, a grocery shop, even a school. now all the fishermen had cleared off, and Østvig had become a hollowed-out shell, overrun with tourists from May to October. \n\nSomeone had placed a sandwich board close to her drive. Straight on for ice cream. She got off her bike and kicked the sign into a rose bush, then had to hobble for a minute, holding her sore foot. \n\nThe road was empty but for a small local boy who stopped and stared at her, mouth agape, fish eyes frowning. 'What are you looking at?' she scowled, shaking her fist. When the boy had gone, she turned right onto the main road and, after about five minutes, headed down the gravel track that cut like a ruler through the pine plantation. The sound of the ocean was more muted here, like a distant exhalation. A wood pigeon called nearby. The air was sweet and mild and buzzing with insects. Gudrun allowed herself a moment of self-pity that this place should be lost to her, and so soon. Sweeping flies away from her face, she rested her bike against a silver birch and concealed it with bracken.\n\nFor as long as she could remember, she had been the guardian of the chanterelles, and what was to become of them without her? Who now would bear witness to their beauty? Her father had shown her the almost invisible deer paths that criss-crossed these woods, pointing to the mould- coloured lichen, oak saplings and thick green moss that the chanterelles favoured. They grew low, partly covered by vegetation, like gold coins scattered on the weedy bottom of a lake. \n\nShe came to a sandy hollow, dappled with sunlight. it was one of her most reliable patches, and it took her only a few minutes to find the first chanterelle. The sight of the little golden disc made her heart leap, as though it had revealed itself especially for her. \n\nShe knelt down with flies circling her head and slid two fingers around the chanterelle. it was cool under the moss. The knife sliced easily through the stem. \n\nLike an offering to the gods, she held the pale orange trumpet up to the light, closed her eyes and inhaled its scent of wet stone and old, sweet apples. \n\nA noise close by startled her. she dropped the mush- room. someone was laughing in disbelief, the laughter punctured by little gasps and screams. \n\n'Nej, nej, nej, nej,' said a male voice. \n\nGudrun moved towards the sound, keeping her feet on the thick, slippery moss that silenced her steps, and taking care not to snap any twigs or branches. Her heart beat sickeningly fast. \n\nSomething red showed between the trees: an anorak. It bobbed up and down as the stranger darted to and fro, bending and standing. \n\nAnd there was something else: the forest floor was virtually shimmering with gold, even from where Gudrun was squatting behind a stunted pine, it was obvious that there were hundreds, perhaps thousands, of chanterelles in there. \n\nShe must have made a sound after all, because the man suddenly raised his head and swivelled around to look right at her. \nHe was young enough to have been her son, perhaps in his late thirties. His chubby cheeks were plum-coloured with excitement, his long, greying hair tousled and wild. \n\n'Hej,' he said. Just like that, as though they were old friends. \n\nThis had a disarming effect on Gudrun. she felt herself softening towards him. \n\n'This is unbelievable, so many. come.' He waved. 'come and see.' \n\nShe didn't want to, but something pulled her forward, as if by a rope tied around her waist. \n\nAs she pushed through the branches, she wondered if she was dreaming. if maybe the painkillers they had given her yesterday at the hospital were causing her to hallucinate. \n\nHer eyes took in a rucksack, tossed aside in a patch of bare sand and next to it a clipboard with a few crumpled sheets of paper on it. The man looked at her warmly. 'I see you have the tools of the trade,' he said, nodding at her basket. 'A fellow mushroom hunter.' \n\nShe opened and closed her mouth like a cod, silenced by his forward manner. \n\n'Do you live locally?' he asked. she nodded feebly. 'Then, if you don't mind,' he said, picking up the clipboard and taking down a pencil from behind his ear 'could you tell me where else I might find chanterelles in this plantation?' \n\nGudrun noticed with alarm that the papers attached to the clipboard were photocopies of small-scale maps. \n\n'No, no, it's not like that,' the man said. 'I won't be picking them. it's purely for scientific purposes - Aalborg University.' He fished an id card out of his pocket. \n\nGudrun stared at it, marvelling at the barefaced cheek of this Torben Larsen, Research Scientist, Department of Chemistry and Bioscience. she was still too astounded to speak. \n\nShe gave back the id card and noticed that Torben Larsen hadn't yet picked any chanterelles but instead filled two tiny specimen containers with moss and sand. \n\n'Perhaps it's easier if you look at the map,' he said, handing her the clipboard. 'it's local people like you who make all the difference. no amount of years in a laboratory could replace what you know.' \n\nGudrun thought of what the vicar had said earlier. Was this the sort of stranger he had had in mind? \n\n'Are you fond of chanterelles?' she managed to stutter. \n\n'Oh, yes,' he said. 'my parents used to take me hunting for them. That's what kicked all this off.' \n\n'All this?' said Gudrun. \n\n'I'm trying to pinpoint the conditions in which chanterelles thrive. The exact type of soil they need, the required species of surrounding vegetation and so on. The more sites like this that i am able to study, the more I will know.' \n\nShe squinted at him. Torben Larsen had his back to the sunlight. it made his protruding ears look a luminous red, almost transparent. \n\n'You used the word \"exact\",' she said. 'Of course, you must already know that there is no such thing as exact when it comes to chanterelles. They are free-spirited little things.' \n\n'Fantastic.' He rushed over to the rucksack and retrieved a notebook. 'The way you just put that.' He repeated it to himself as he wrote: 'Free-spirited little things.' \n\nGudrun meanwhile looked at the map, easily picking out the main road and the neat grid of tracks on either side of it. Torben Larsen came back and passed her the pencil. 'You can outline the patches with this, if you like.' \n\nShe shook her head vigorously. 'No maps. nothing must ever be committed to paper.' \n\n'Right you are,' Torben Larsen said, tapping the side of his nose. 'Good point, um . . .' \n\n'Gudrun Holm.' \n\n'Good point, Mrs Holm. You never know what hands such information might fall into.' \n\nShe looked up at him. 'Precisely, and it's Miss Holm,' she said, before making a momentous decision. \n\nShe took a deep breath. 'But I could point them out to you, if you like?' \n\nFor a moment, she considered confiding in him that she was dying, but something stopped her, something that had been niggling away at the back of her mind, a question. \n\n'Before I do,' she said. 'Tell me, why do you need to know so much?' \n\nTorben Larsen looked sheepish and excited at the same time. He lowered his voice. 'I wasn't going to say anything, but I think I can trust you. One secret deserves another, right?' \n\n'Trust me with what?' Gudrun said, narrowing her eyes. \n\nHe held up his thumb and index finger, a centimetre apart. 'I'm about this close to a huge breakthrough, Miss Holm, something that has eluded scientists for years.' \n\nHe bent down and carefully picked a chanterelle. \n\n'Soon,' he said. 'Beauties like this will be cultivated in greenhouses and poly-tunnels all over the world, thanks to what I've discovered.' \n\nThe clipboard became butter in Gudrun's hands, sliding out of her grip and landing on a heap of pinecones. Her nausea returned. she waved her hands helplessly in front of her chest. \n\n'They will be on the menu of every restaurant and on everybody's lips. They will conquer the world,' Torben Larsen said, blind to her distress. \n\nGudrun found her voice. it was whinging and weak. 'But it's impossible,' she said. 'People have tried, of course, but chanterelles are too fussy, it will never take off.' \n\n'Oh yes it will. I'm almost certain I have found a way to mimic the symbiotic relationship between these fungi and tree roots under laboratory conditions,' Torben Larsen said, his eyes shining with a strange, brilliant light. \n\nHe slapped Gudrun's back, almost causing her to fall forward. she gasped for air, hands on her knees, swallowing bile. \n\n'I'm talking about mass production, Miss Holm, a brand new reliable food source. You will not need to pick these mushrooms ever again. You will be able to buy them in your local supermarket - fresh, tinned, frozen, freeze- dried, you name it, isn't it great?' \n\nHe laughed, mistaking her horror for amazement, her disgust for mock disbelief. \n\n'Stop,' she said, pressing her hands to her ears. 'in God's name, stop.' \n\nShe looked wildly around the clearing. it had started to spin before her eyes, like a gold and green wheel. But Torben Larsen kept on laughing as though he had said the funniest thing. \n\nHis mouth was full of dark fillings, she saw now, and his nails were bitten right down to the peeling, bleeding skin. There were nicotine stains on the fingers of his right hand. \n\nHer beautiful chanterelles. Torben Larsen would take them and rob them of their rarity, the very thing that made them special. The secret of the Holms would be of less consequence than a gull's feather in a north sea storm. \n\nA purple dusk fell over her eyes. she gripped the mush- room knife in her pocket so tightly that it felt as though her veins would burst. \n\n'You stupid, stupid man!' she screamed. \n\nTorben Larsen fell heavily, still with a self-congratulatory smile on his lips. He clutched his anorak and looked down in surprise at the beetroot stain spreading across his chest. Then his eyes rolled back, starting unseeingly at the summer sky, while a bluebottle crawled across his face. \n\nGudrun pulled back the knife. There was a lot of blood. she wiped her boots on the bracken and buried her jumper in the sodden ground with Torben Larsen's rucksack and papers. nature would take care of his body. Not many people crossed the woods at Østvig, and by the time he was found, if ever, she would be long dead herself. \n\nIt was only when she neared the house that her legs began to tremble on the bike. The sun beat down on the tarmac and pearls of sweat ran down the back of her neck. It was windier now and the sea was up, getting noisier as she shortened the distance between herself and the beach. \n\nWhen she got home, she would have a bath, then get under the cool covers of her bed, close her eyes and never rise again. 'But what about the chanterelles?' a little voice inside her insisted. 'What will it all have been for, if you don't tell anyone about them now?'\n\nThe local boy from earlier was back, poking the lyme grass with a stick as though trying to spike fish. she slowed down and looked at him more closely. There was something singular and wilful about him, something that reminded Gudrun of herself. Again, the vicar's words came back to her. \n\nShe stopped and got off the bike. 'You there,' she cooed to him. The boy looked up, his concentrated expression contorting into one of terror and alarm. He threw down his stick and hunched his shoulders. \n\n'Don't be frightened,' she said, wheeling the bike over to where he stood. 'I won't shout at you this time.' \n\nThe boy looked unconvinced. He was trembling, his dirty little hands balled into fists, his wide eyes fixed on a streak of blood on her thigh. \n\n'It's nothing.  I scratched myself on a branch. But listen to this,' she said. 'There is something I want to tell you, a secret.' \n\nThe boy looked at her warily, but she could tell that he was interested. no child had ever been born who didn't like a secret. \n\n'It's a good secret,' she said. 'The sort that people would do anything to steal from you, but you won't let them. You will defend this secret with your life, even kill for it if you have to.' \n\n'Come,' she said and made him sit down with her on a large white boulder by the side of the road. it was smooth and warm. she felt a great sense of peace spreading through her body. \n\n'Now,' she said, very quietly, though only the crickets and adders and skylarks were around to hear them. \n\n'Do you know what a chanterelle is?'

This collection of darkly chilling but entertaining tales ranges from the commuter who bitterly regrets falling asleep on a late-night train, to the mushroom hunter prepared to kill to guard her secret. Copenhagen becomes a city of twilight and shadows, as canny antique dealers and property sharks get their comeuppance at the hands of old ladies, and ghosts act in most peculiar ways.

The 19 haunting and subtle stories in this anthology come from author Heidi Amsinck who, although born in Copenhagen, writes fluidly and artfully in English. This makes her writing refreshingly accessible for an international audience – although you’re never in any doubt that these tales take place in the slightly strange Scandinavian landscape, whether the setting is an urban art gallery, a woodland on the edge of the wilderness, a run-down antique shop, or the untouched-by-time, end of the railway line.\n\nSome of the stories explore undeniably supernatural themes, but most are firmly grounded in the base desires of human nature. Charlatans and conmen get their comeuppance in these urban fables which lean more towards gothic horror than the traditional fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen. The ‘horror’ is all achieved by suggestion and implication – and many of the stories are shot through with humour as dark as deadly nightshade. There’s frequently a sense of glee in how things transpire, when the tables are turned and the potential exploiter finds himself undone. Amsinck stands up for the under-dogs, the victims, the people who’ve been cheated or who’ve simply been abandoned and ignored by society.\n\nSeveral of the tales explore the theme of escape, of simply walking away from modern society, from an over-crowded life full of white noise and broken dreams. Wish-fulfilment? Maybe. Some of the stories edge into the uncanny and are genuinely unsettling; others are simply sad. None of them is particularly long, although there’s hidden depths between these brief pages.\n\nAs can often be the way with multiple stories from one author, it’s best to read each tale on its own, with space for the scenario to flourish in its own right. Read a whole bunch of them too quickly, too close together, and they lose their identities and will merge into an amorphous muddle. This is a collection to be savoured, slowly, on cold nights when the wind is howling and you can imagine the ice forming in the corners of a disturbed soul.\n\n__8/10__\n\nReviewed by _Rowena Hoseason_\n\nFind out more about Last Train to Helsingoør [here](http://www.muswell-press.co.uk/book/the-last-train-to-helsingor).","news":true,"date":"2018-03-02","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"74yzmb33gIq0iiUO0Su0WQ","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-03-05T13:21:40.506Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-05T13:29:30.499Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"image001-1","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/74yzmb33gIq0iiUO0Su0WQ/09689c4f8b19e5b07b64ce6d502e5880/cropped-mmm-wp171.jpg","details":{"size":35527,"image":{"width":601,"height":150}},"fileName":"cropped-mmm-wp171.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1YDQhxh332ymmy2eqiyS8O","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-02-26T14:09:56.908Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-26T14:09:56.908Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Last Train to Helsingør Book Launch","content":"Celebrating the launch of Last Train to Helsingør by Heidi Amsinck at Daunt Books, Cheapside, London, with actor Tim McInnerny who gave a brilliant, creepy reading.","news":true,"date":"2018-02-21","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1rq9dEjM0s602mSq6E4OWo","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-02-26T14:09:13.819Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-26T14:09:13.819Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Heidi and Tim McInnerny","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/1rq9dEjM0s602mSq6E4OWo/f3b4258cd3a39566b55c55d0e05ada44/IMG_6228.JPG","details":{"size":172293,"image":{"width":480,"height":640}},"fileName":"IMG_6228.JPG","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"Z5loCbJo8EEIAuu6CygEq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-02-16T11:00:35.731Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-05T13:17:44.843Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"The chanterelles of Østvig","author":"TripFiction","content":"## Nordic Noir: short stories set in Denmark, and chatting to the author about Copenhagen\n\n__Read the original article [here](https://www.tripfiction.com/nordic-noir-short-stories-set-denmark-chatting-author-copenhagen/).__\n\nLast Train to Helsingør is the eponymous title of the first story in this slim volume, full of duplicitous perpetrators and situations with underlying menace.\n\nMany are set in Copenhagen, but some are set beyond the capital, on the train to Helsingør, or Brokholm further North, for example.\n\nConniving elderly women will surely hook their victim in, the lure of an ancient Chinese vase too much for one antique dealer.

The thought of them growing unnoticed in the forest after her death was unbearable. \n\nShe pushed back the covers and sat up in bed, wincing at the pain. It was everywhere now, not just in her chest. Her breaths were wheezy and ineffective, her lungs like perforated bellows.\n\nThrough the open window, she could hear the eternal sigh of the north sea. The dawn air was damp and fragrant with rose hip and wet grass. No wind stirred the net curtains. \n\nShe snatched a whining mosquito out of the air and squashed its quivering limbs between her fingers before setting two feet on the cold floor. \n                                                                                      \nFive generations of Holms had picked chanterelles in the great sand-dune plantations. She was the last of the line, the only person living to know where the chanterelles of Østvig grew. unless she told someone. \n\nA stench of spoiled fish greeted her in the kitchen, last night's cod. in the end, she had not had the appetite for it. She emptied the pan outside by the woodpile, something would eat the fish - foxes, rats, gulls. \n\nLike her body when they finally put her in the ground, the cod would be reclaimed by nature, nothing was wasted in the end. Even her own flesh would make a feast, if only for maggots. \n\nShe looked out over the dunes, followed a V-formation of migrating geese pulling across the flat expanse of lyme grass and heather. The sky was bigger here than elsewhere in Denmark. The deep blue light cast a primeval glow on the landscape, as though it had never been morning there before. she licked her lips and tasted salt. \n\nThe vicar picked up on the seventh ring, his voice thick with sleep. 'Gudrun. You are up early.' \n\n'Vicar, I'm dying,' she said, brushing off his noises of sympathy. 'But that's not why I'm calling.' \n\n'No?' \n\nShe pictured the vicar squinting beneath his great domed forehead, his hand crabbing across the bedside table as he searched for his glasses. She stemmed her impatience at his dithering. After all, he had known her as a child and would, by long-standing agreement, be the one laying her to rest in a few short weeks. There would be no mourners. \n\n'I wish to pass something on to you,' she said. 'it's about the chanterelles. I want to tell you where to find them.' she allowed a pause for the vicar's reaction. It wasn't much. \n\n'Oh,' he said. 'Oh, I see.' \n\n'Well?' she said. 'Will you come with me today, so I can show you?' \n\nWhen the vicar cleared his throat, she could tell that he was about to disappoint her. \n\n'I'm old, Gudrun, and won't be long after you in Heaven. You don't want to trust me with something so important,' he said. \n\n'But you're the only person I know,' she protested. \n\nThe vicar did not bother to contradict her, everyone knew that Gudrun Holm disliked people. \n\nThere was a moment's pause before he spoke again. 'Then there is only one other option.' \n\n'What?' Gudrun asked suspiciously. \n\n'It's obvious,' he said. 'it has to be someone you are yet to meet.' \n\nshe rang off. \n\n'Easy for you,' she spat, her voice echoing in the empty house. 'You forget this isn't exactly Copenhagen central station.' \nShe sharpened her mushroom knife standing by the sink soothed by the feel of its pear-shaped wooden handle in the palm of her hand. The kitchen window was greasy with sea fret, no matter how often she washed her windows, the sea always won. \n\nAfter drying it carefully, she wrapped the knife in a dishcloth and placed it in the faded wicker basket that was older than herself. Then she slipped a worn tracksuit top over her T-shirt, found her battered leather walking boots and tied a multi-coloured scarf over the itchy stubble on her scalp. \n\nThe bones in her buttocks grated against the saddle as she cycled slowly up the dirt track. How many more days would she be able to do this before the rest of her strength ebbed away? Two? Three? \n\nWhen she reached the main road, she looked to the left where the village houses lay like a jumble of Lego bricks on the horizon. \n\nA car passed, a sleek black number with German plates. Østvig was not what it used to be, not since they had knocked up all those new holiday homes. Once there had been fourteen sky-blue boats fishing the north sea from the village, a grocery shop, even a school. now all the fishermen had cleared off, and Østvig had become a hollowed-out shell, overrun with tourists from May to October. \n\nSomeone had placed a sandwich board close to her drive. Straight on for ice cream. She got off her bike and kicked the sign into a rose bush, then had to hobble for a minute, holding her sore foot. \n\nThe road was empty but for a small local boy who stopped and stared at her, mouth agape, fish eyes frowning. 'What are you looking at?' she scowled, shaking her fist. When the boy had gone, she turned right onto the main road and, after about five minutes, headed down the gravel track that cut like a ruler through the pine plantation. The sound of the ocean was more muted here, like a distant exhalation. A wood pigeon called nearby. The air was sweet and mild and buzzing with insects. Gudrun allowed herself a moment of self-pity that this place should be lost to her, and so soon. Sweeping flies away from her face, she rested her bike against a silver birch and concealed it with bracken.\n\nFor as long as she could remember, she had been the guardian of the chanterelles, and what was to become of them without her? Who now would bear witness to their beauty? Her father had shown her the almost invisible deer paths that criss-crossed these woods, pointing to the mould- coloured lichen, oak saplings and thick green moss that the chanterelles favoured. They grew low, partly covered by vegetation, like gold coins scattered on the weedy bottom of a lake. \n\nShe came to a sandy hollow, dappled with sunlight. it was one of her most reliable patches, and it took her only a few minutes to find the first chanterelle. The sight of the little golden disc made her heart leap, as though it had revealed itself especially for her. \n\nShe knelt down with flies circling her head and slid two fingers around the chanterelle. it was cool under the moss. The knife sliced easily through the stem. \n\nLike an offering to the gods, she held the pale orange trumpet up to the light, closed her eyes and inhaled its scent of wet stone and old, sweet apples. \n\nA noise close by startled her. she dropped the mush- room. someone was laughing in disbelief, the laughter punctured by little gasps and screams. \n\n'Nej, nej, nej, nej,' said a male voice. \n\nGudrun moved towards the sound, keeping her feet on the thick, slippery moss that silenced her steps, and taking care not to snap any twigs or branches. Her heart beat sickeningly fast. \n\nSomething red showed between the trees: an anorak. It bobbed up and down as the stranger darted to and fro, bending and standing. \n\nAnd there was something else: the forest floor was virtually shimmering with gold, even from where Gudrun was squatting behind a stunted pine, it was obvious that there were hundreds, perhaps thousands, of chanterelles in there. \n\nShe must have made a sound after all, because the man suddenly raised his head and swivelled around to look right at her. \nHe was young enough to have been her son, perhaps in his late thirties. His chubby cheeks were plum-coloured with excitement, his long, greying hair tousled and wild. \n\n'Hej,' he said. Just like that, as though they were old friends. \n\nThis had a disarming effect on Gudrun. she felt herself softening towards him. \n\n'This is unbelievable, so many. come.' He waved. 'come and see.' \n\nShe didn't want to, but something pulled her forward, as if by a rope tied around her waist. \n\nAs she pushed through the branches, she wondered if she was dreaming. if maybe the painkillers they had given her yesterday at the hospital were causing her to hallucinate. \n\nHer eyes took in a rucksack, tossed aside in a patch of bare sand and next to it a clipboard with a few crumpled sheets of paper on it. The man looked at her warmly. 'I see you have the tools of the trade,' he said, nodding at her basket. 'A fellow mushroom hunter.' \n\nShe opened and closed her mouth like a cod, silenced by his forward manner. \n\n'Do you live locally?' he asked. she nodded feebly. 'Then, if you don't mind,' he said, picking up the clipboard and taking down a pencil from behind his ear 'could you tell me where else I might find chanterelles in this plantation?' \n\nGudrun noticed with alarm that the papers attached to the clipboard were photocopies of small-scale maps. \n\n'No, no, it's not like that,' the man said. 'I won't be picking them. it's purely for scientific purposes - Aalborg University.' He fished an id card out of his pocket. \n\nGudrun stared at it, marvelling at the barefaced cheek of this Torben Larsen, Research Scientist, Department of Chemistry and Bioscience. she was still too astounded to speak. \n\nShe gave back the id card and noticed that Torben Larsen hadn't yet picked any chanterelles but instead filled two tiny specimen containers with moss and sand. \n\n'Perhaps it's easier if you look at the map,' he said, handing her the clipboard. 'it's local people like you who make all the difference. no amount of years in a laboratory could replace what you know.' \n\nGudrun thought of what the vicar had said earlier. Was this the sort of stranger he had had in mind? \n\n'Are you fond of chanterelles?' she managed to stutter. \n\n'Oh, yes,' he said. 'my parents used to take me hunting for them. That's what kicked all this off.' \n\n'All this?' said Gudrun. \n\n'I'm trying to pinpoint the conditions in which chanterelles thrive. The exact type of soil they need, the required species of surrounding vegetation and so on. The more sites like this that i am able to study, the more I will know.' \n\nShe squinted at him. Torben Larsen had his back to the sunlight. it made his protruding ears look a luminous red, almost transparent. \n\n'You used the word \"exact\",' she said. 'Of course, you must already know that there is no such thing as exact when it comes to chanterelles. They are free-spirited little things.' \n\n'Fantastic.' He rushed over to the rucksack and retrieved a notebook. 'The way you just put that.' He repeated it to himself as he wrote: 'Free-spirited little things.' \n\nGudrun meanwhile looked at the map, easily picking out the main road and the neat grid of tracks on either side of it. Torben Larsen came back and passed her the pencil. 'You can outline the patches with this, if you like.' \n\nShe shook her head vigorously. 'No maps. nothing must ever be committed to paper.' \n\n'Right you are,' Torben Larsen said, tapping the side of his nose. 'Good point, um . . .' \n\n'Gudrun Holm.' \n\n'Good point, Mrs Holm. You never know what hands such information might fall into.' \n\nShe looked up at him. 'Precisely, and it's Miss Holm,' she said, before making a momentous decision. \n\nShe took a deep breath. 'But I could point them out to you, if you like?' \n\nFor a moment, she considered confiding in him that she was dying, but something stopped her, something that had been niggling away at the back of her mind, a question. \n\n'Before I do,' she said. 'Tell me, why do you need to know so much?' \n\nTorben Larsen looked sheepish and excited at the same time. He lowered his voice. 'I wasn't going to say anything, but I think I can trust you. One secret deserves another, right?' \n\n'Trust me with what?' Gudrun said, narrowing her eyes. \n\nHe held up his thumb and index finger, a centimetre apart. 'I'm about this close to a huge breakthrough, Miss Holm, something that has eluded scientists for years.' \n\nHe bent down and carefully picked a chanterelle. \n\n'Soon,' he said. 'Beauties like this will be cultivated in greenhouses and poly-tunnels all over the world, thanks to what I've discovered.' \n\nThe clipboard became butter in Gudrun's hands, sliding out of her grip and landing on a heap of pinecones. Her nausea returned. she waved her hands helplessly in front of her chest. \n\n'They will be on the menu of every restaurant and on everybody's lips. They will conquer the world,' Torben Larsen said, blind to her distress. \n\nGudrun found her voice. it was whinging and weak. 'But it's impossible,' she said. 'People have tried, of course, but chanterelles are too fussy, it will never take off.' \n\n'Oh yes it will. I'm almost certain I have found a way to mimic the symbiotic relationship between these fungi and tree roots under laboratory conditions,' Torben Larsen said, his eyes shining with a strange, brilliant light. \n\nHe slapped Gudrun's back, almost causing her to fall forward. she gasped for air, hands on her knees, swallowing bile. \n\n'I'm talking about mass production, Miss Holm, a brand new reliable food source. You will not need to pick these mushrooms ever again. You will be able to buy them in your local supermarket - fresh, tinned, frozen, freeze- dried, you name it, isn't it great?' \n\nHe laughed, mistaking her horror for amazement, her disgust for mock disbelief. \n\n'Stop,' she said, pressing her hands to her ears. 'in God's name, stop.' \n\nShe looked wildly around the clearing. it had started to spin before her eyes, like a gold and green wheel. But Torben Larsen kept on laughing as though he had said the funniest thing. \n\nHis mouth was full of dark fillings, she saw now, and his nails were bitten right down to the peeling, bleeding skin. There were nicotine stains on the fingers of his right hand. \n\nHer beautiful chanterelles. Torben Larsen would take them and rob them of their rarity, the very thing that made them special. The secret of the Holms would be of less consequence than a gull's feather in a north sea storm. \n\nA purple dusk fell over her eyes. she gripped the mush- room knife in her pocket so tightly that it felt as though her veins would burst. \n\n'You stupid, stupid man!' she screamed. \n\nTorben Larsen fell heavily, still with a self-congratulatory smile on his lips. He clutched his anorak and looked down in surprise at the beetroot stain spreading across his chest. Then his eyes rolled back, starting unseeingly at the summer sky, while a bluebottle crawled across his face. \n\nGudrun pulled back the knife. There was a lot of blood. she wiped her boots on the bracken and buried her jumper in the sodden ground with Torben Larsen's rucksack and papers. nature would take care of his body. Not many people crossed the woods at Østvig, and by the time he was found, if ever, she would be long dead herself. \n\nIt was only when she neared the house that her legs began to tremble on the bike. The sun beat down on the tarmac and pearls of sweat ran down the back of her neck. It was windier now and the sea was up, getting noisier as she shortened the distance between herself and the beach. \n\nWhen she got home, she would have a bath, then get under the cool covers of her bed, close her eyes and never rise again. 'But what about the chanterelles?' a little voice inside her insisted. 'What will it all have been for, if you don't tell anyone about them now?'\n\nThe local boy from earlier was back, poking the lyme grass with a stick as though trying to spike fish. she slowed down and looked at him more closely. There was something singular and wilful about him, something that reminded Gudrun of herself. Again, the vicar's words came back to her. \n\nShe stopped and got off the bike. 'You there,' she cooed to him. The boy looked up, his concentrated expression contorting into one of terror and alarm. He threw down his stick and hunched his shoulders. \n\n'Don't be frightened,' she said, wheeling the bike over to where he stood. 'I won't shout at you this time.' \n\nThe boy looked unconvinced.

'There is something I want to tell you, a secret.' \n\nThe boy looked at her warily, but she could tell that he was interested. no child had ever been born who didn't like a secret. \n\n'It's a good secret,' she said. 'The sort that people would do anything to steal from you, but you won't let them. You will defend this secret with your life, even kill for it if you have to.' \n\n'Come,' she said and made him sit down with her on a large white boulder by the side of the road. it was smooth and warm. she felt a great sense of peace spreading through her body. \n\n'Now,' she said, very quietly, though only the crickets and adders and skylarks were around to hear them. \n\n'Do you know what a chanterelle is?'

The golden, trumpet-shaped mushrooms grow wild in the great dune plantations of Denmark's far north, and every year we get together in a wooden cabin to hunt for them. \n\n![fullsizeoutput 128b[6][2][4]](//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/4FG1JwPn96Ey0G6WiE84Si/0fc94576538b27b37eb9894faa956e1b/fullsizeoutput_128b_6__2__4_.jpeg)\n\nMy late father, Finn, could walk the seemingly endless forest trails with his eyes closed. He knew where the chanterelles grew, but refused to commit his knowledge to paper, and taught us kids how to hide our tracks and put other mushroom hunters off the scent. The elusiveness of chanterelles appealed to his independent and wilful spirit, as did the fact that they cannot be cultivated. \n\nBut what if someone worked out how to farm them? What if chanterelles became as common as any other mushroom, and a butter-sautéed feast of them could be had any day of the week? And, if a lover of chanterelles - such as my father - got the chance to stop this from happening, what would they do?\n\nYou'll have to read the story to find out for yourself, but let's just say that in the depths of the Danish pine forests, no one can hear you scream.\n\nIn my story, the protagonist is loosely based on an eccentric woman who lives locally to our cabin by the beach. Østvig could any one of dozens of quiet fishing villages, lining the rough North Sea coast.\n\nI lost my beloved father, but kept his secret. I, too, know where the chanterelles grow. To this day, walking through the secluded woods, pushing through dense branches on a carpet of moss and coming across a hollow shimmering with golden fungi, remains one of my greatest pleasures.\n\nIf you have never tried chanterelle hunting, I urge you to give it a go. But if you meet an old woman out there, with a woven basket and a mushroom knife, you might want to run in the other direction.\n\n![IMG 2298](//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/2kQlF3RMAQAwmMU8G2giqQ/b23913acaef2d81f8c7f4820ed409cd3/IMG_2298.jpeg) \n\nFind out more about visiting Denmark [here](https://www.visitdenmark.co.uk/en-gb/denmark/discover-denmark-exciting-city-breaks-and-stunning-nature).","news":true,"date":"2018-02-08","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"27OJSFJomkuE0684IIkSKu","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-02-08T17:08:01.371Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-08T17:08:01.371Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Murder in the Woods","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/27OJSFJomkuE0684IIkSKu/d485aba5f3f5800b5e51baebd21b53d0/IMG_4379.jpeg","details":{"size":81713,"image":{"width":640,"height":248}},"fileName":"IMG_4379.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"43jf1fG3FuIkAcoqWcSuYc","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-31T15:10:01.428Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-05T13:27:47.215Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Daily Mail review of Last Train","text":"A nice slice of creepy Scandi-noir","author":"Daily Mail","date":"2018-02-01"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3U4twzdIZOqYIAkcoWKigk","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-02-28T14:44:17.572Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-05T13:13:14.957Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"MurderMayhem&More's Recommends Last Train to Helsingør","author":"MurderMayhem&More","content":"[MurderMayhem&More](https://murdermayhemandmore.wordpress.com/2018/01/26/crime-time-new-books-and-recommended-reads-5/) recently reviewed Last Train to Helsingør:\n\n### Crime Time: new books and recommended reads\n\n#### _LAST TRAIN TO HELSINGØR by Heidi Amsinck_\n\n_This Danish author is unusual in that she writes in English, exploring the shadows of Scandinavian society in a series of short stories. This collection of darkly chilling but entertaining tales ranges from the commuter who bitterly regrets falling asleep on a late-night train, to the mushroom hunter prepared to kill to guard her secret. Copenhagen becomes a city of twilight and shadows, as canny antique dealers and property sharks get their comeuppance at the hands of old ladies, and ghosts act in most peculiar ways. You may recognise some of the stories which have been dramatised for radio – they’re the perfect introduction to Nordic noir if you’ve wondered what all the fuss is about._\n\nSee their other recommendations [here](https://murdermayhemandmore.wordpress.com/2018/01/26/crime-time-new-books-and-recommended-reads-5/).","news":true,"date":"2018-02-28","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"2LyqEBXErKA64GQ8u8OEsu","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-02-28T14:44:14.554Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-28T14:44:14.554Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"crimescene-header","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/2LyqEBXErKA64GQ8u8OEsu/989e158385adbfb71a7b47f89b9cea44/crimescene-header.jpg","details":{"size":129173,"image":{"width":1400,"height":623}},"fileName":"crimescene-header.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"4k5qoizHm0g06sM8Q4k6A2","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-03-07T11:12:20.809Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-07T11:12:20.809Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Last Train to Helsingør reviews on Goodreads","author":"Blair, Goodreads","content":"The title story, which opens the collection, is as though Jeremy de Quidt's *'The Wrong Train'* has been rewritten for adults by someone who's recently read Robert Aickman's 'The Hospice'. It's a promising start, and many of the other tales live up to it. *'The Music Box'* is a cautionary tale of a collector's lust for a cursed object; 'The Tallboy' spins an equally enjoyable scene around a similar premise. *'The Light from Dead Stars'* is a crime story in which a police inspector, about to retire, is handed an unexpected clue to a a cold case that has long tortured him. *'The Bird in the Cage'* is a nasty little fable like something out of Grimm. I loved the ghost stories *'The Man Upstairs'*, about an unseen neighbour and a 'ghastly' face at a window; *'The Night Guard'*, in which a man finds himself trapped in his favourite art gallery after closing time; *'The Crying'*, a very dark story in which an immoral and deceptive protagonist gets his comeuppance; *'Room Service'*, the tale of an inept chef and a strange request, which might have been my favourite. The weakest stories were a little too twee for my tastes: I wasn't keen on *'Like White Rain'*, *'The Ghost of Helene Jørgensen'* and especially the rather smug *'Detained'* for this reason. All in all, however, this is a really strong collection of noir and ghost stories with fantastic pacing and atmosphere. One to settle down with and read in a single sitting on a rainy afternoon or cold night.\n\n__4/5 stars__\n\nYou can read the original review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2196629414)","news":true,"date":"2018-03-07","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"NFJuX13QwmwMUUqmSyOq8","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-03-07T11:11:41.278Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-07T11:11:41.278Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Screen Shot 2018-03-07 at 11.10.05","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/NFJuX13QwmwMUUqmSyOq8/3b517b2d24fe66277aaf969ffee67e0a/Screen_Shot_2018-03-07_at_11.10.05.png","details":{"size":485473,"image":{"width":1432,"height":746}},"fileName":"Screen Shot 2018-03-07 at 11.10.05.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3YdkO6Bcf6AeMoEaqS8Kay","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-04-12T11:32:35.354Z","updatedAt":"2018-04-12T11:32:35.354Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"The Last Train to Helsingør now No. 3 at WHSmith Travel","content":"We're excited to see that the Last Train to Helsingør is now No. 3 at [WHSmith](https://www.whsmith.co.uk/products/last-train-to-helsingor-danish-noir/9780995482241) Travel.

Beal said the duo had “inherited a small but interesting backlist which we are looking at rejuvenating”, with plans to publish both fiction, including crime and a gay interest fiction list, and non-fiction.\n\nBeal told The Bookseller: “We decided to do this as between us we have built up over 60 years of experience in the publishing business, working for some exceptional houses. But we decided we want to be our own bosses and bring all that experience, knowledge and enthusiasm to publish what we believe in and feel there is a market for. Running all sides of the business and taking the risks ourselves will be challenging and exciting.”\n\nKate Beal was a sales rep for Bloomsbury for 10 years before running the PR and publicity departments at Ottakar’s. She was then head of sales at Faber for a further 10 years, followed by sales director stints at Walker Books and Oneworld. Sarah Beal spent 21 years at Bloomsbury, occupying roles as publicity, marketing and sales director, and oversaw the launch of Harry Potter internationally, before going on to work as marketing director for HarperCollins.\n\nMuswell’s first titles under the new ownership will appear this autumn, with a fuller list to follow in spring 2018. Out in November will be The Rainbow Conspiracy by choreographer Stuart Hopps, set in the mid-1980s, with theatrical agent Clive Spoke embarking on a quest to find the truth about his ex-lover’s early death and uncovering a conspiracy against the burgeoning gay community in the US (£8.99). It will be followed in February 2018 by The Last Train to Helsingor, a first collection of stories from Copenhagen-born Heidi Amsinck (£8.99), many of them originally commissioned for BBC Radio 4.\n\nKate and Sarah Beal said they were “committed to editorial excellence, high-quality production and marketing our books with flair.”\n\nKate Beal can be contacted at [kate@muswell-press.co.uk](mailto:kate@muswell-press.co.uk).\n\nRead the original artcile [here](https://www.thebookseller.com/news/beal-leaves-oneworld-muswell-press-venture-591691).","news":true,"date":"2017-11-16T00:00+00:00","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1l3nrPIAQ82AAiUK2sCYOA","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-01-23T18:54:39.417Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-23T18:54:39.417Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Peeking","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/1l3nrPIAQ82AAiUK2sCYOA/cb475014b2a331987a3bbdc8e4b7a446/DNo9rTcW0AAHmjp.jpg","details":{"size":102893,"image":{"width":1200,"height":801}},"fileName":"DNo9rTcW0AAHmjp.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5C0bV7fDRCiuuC0qIooKgS","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-01-23T21:07:37.756Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-23T21:21:01.901Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Interview with Stuart Hopps","author":"Boyz.co.uk","link":"http://boyz.co.uk/the-rainbow-conspiracy-interview-with-author-stuart-hopps/","date":"2017-11-02"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"20WJm4m1dqAC8AMW8e4qOm","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-22T14:22:08.106Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-23T21:07:41.831Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":12,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"book"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"The Rainbow Conspiracy","releaseDate":"2017-11-01T12:00+01:00","bookEdition":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5BDPsj11rGaM8AkskigywE","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-26T16:29:21.164Z","updatedAt":"2017-12-05T13:30:34.767Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"The Rainbow Conspiracy Paperback","format":"Paperback","isbn":"9780995482227","price":"£10.99","dimensions":"216 x 138 mm","amazonProductCode":"0995482225"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"21wkaWYwUIWqo8I0Ga6sSQ","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-17T11:52:45.779Z","updatedAt":"2017-12-05T13:30:49.994Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"rainbow ebook","format":"eBook","isbn":"9780995482234","price":"£4.99","amazonProductCode":"B076C8GN6Y"}}],"blurb":"It is the mid eighties and successful theatrical agent Clive Spoke embarks on a quest to find the truth about his ex-lover’s early death.

Take The Walk to the Paradise Garden by north-London based New Yorker Leon Arden. I’d never heard of him or, indeed, his publishers and might have foolishly passed this by. But you can judge a book by its opening pages and once I had started, I was hooked. This one is a delight, beautifully written, funny and deeply sad in turn.\n\n'It tells the story of Russell-Morgan-Stern, a photographer, his irascible, strangely obsessive father, Jacob; and his mother, Beryl, a Jewish Marge Simpson. But the star of the book is uncle Sol, “a short, bald, bull of a man ready for a fight,” a human Brillo pad, always abrasive and ready to scour his nearest and dearest with an argument.\n\n'The first 160 pages tell the story of Russ’s childhood and adolescence, battling with parents, teachers, and later, girlfriends who apparently hadn’t been told that it was the Swinging Sixties. It is hilarious, but even here, there are hints of something darker to come. Jacob is constantly telling his family how he put down someone with a perfect one-liner or comeback line but, one day, Russ witnesses an encounter between his father and another driver in a car park and later, overhearing Jacob’s account, full of the usual bravado, “remembered triumphs fell to dust.”\n\n'The next chapter describes a nerdish music appreciation teacher and ends with a twist so powerful that it is worth the price of the book on its own.\n\n'The second, darker half contains some of the most moving accounts of illness and death I have read in years, punctured only once by a laugh-out-loud moment of dark comedy which all fans of Uncle Sol will relish.'

Harding, a seventeen year old boy, is catapulted. He has to survive against a cruel tyrant who has enslaved his country. He finds shelter among a hidden band of dissidents and has his first passionate love affair with one of the girls who finally sacrifices her life for him. Joe heads a rebellion against the tyrant and liberates the country. In the final fight he is attacked and finds himself back on his own planet. The two years he has been away - although only a few minutes in his own time - are a rites of passage which changes him utterly and forever.","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5pwkPYBFsWaqGoQQQu8GMs","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:22:20.306Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-24T12:05:56.600Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Ruth Boswell","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"7BTdDVGIJUqSYGGuQogi4W","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-30T14:42:45.838Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-30T14:50:55.274Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Ruth Boswell Profile Picture","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/7BTdDVGIJUqSYGGuQogi4W/5d5ab0e08744080c1c4d15c4d7bf3e4e/ruth-boswell.jpg","details":{"size":118967,"image":{"width":2048,"height":1536}},"fileName":"ruth-boswell.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"biography":"Ruth Boswell was born in Austria and came to the UK in 1938.

She also brought the Moscow Piano Trio over to perform at a concert for the children of Iraq at the Hackney Empire, east London, in October that year. \n \nShe established Muswell Press in the 1990s publishing a plethora of titles from poetry and polemic to fiction and memoir.

The story reflects on the halting journey from boyhood to manhood, the choices that people make and their consequences. Through the fragile yet implacable logic of the inner lives of the characters, we see how lives can be lost to drugs, sons lost to mothers and how inner city riots might happen. The complexities of familial, community, class and relationship based loyalties are examined with humour and hard-hitting compassion.","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1vvfR2KG6gS0KCWQGIC0sm","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:21:41.695Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-24T13:18:50.437Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Paul Connor-Kearns","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"2fq5w15Zy8YIEkeemoSke6","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-30T14:48:29.734Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-30T14:50:32.674Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Paul Connor-Kearns Profile Picture","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/2fq5w15Zy8YIEkeemoSke6/209305df475a7d122835689576dd287d/1083daecpack.jpg","details":{"size":5079,"image":{"width":160,"height":198}},"fileName":"1083daecpack.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"biography":"Paul Connor-Kearns was born in Oldham and spent his formative years travelling and working in Europe and the Middle East.

After leaving the University of Kent he responded to a newspaper advertisement: Children’s writer needs assistant. Pipe-smokers and those with beards need not apply. He was neither and so became Hawk-eye to Big Chief I-SPY, the writer of the famous series of factual books for children. Within weeks he was writing the regular I-SPY column in the Daily Mail and went on to produce several of the books, including I-SPY Football, Cricket, At The Airport, Birds, Foreign Coins and Cats, a valuable grounding for the world of fiction writing which was to follow later.\n\nAfter spells at the IBA, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (now Ofcom), John joined Thames Television in 1976 and stayed for thirteen years, working first in sport and then in the documentary and features department.  He was programme editor of the pioneering daytime programme, Afternoon Plus which later transferred to Channel 4 as Mavis on 4. When Thames lost its franchise he formed Pineapple Productions and became an independent producer, making programmes for the BBC, ITV and several of the newly emerging digital channels. John continues to make programmes as a freelance producer and director.\n\nHe has written all his working life, for newspapers, magazines, radio and television. There was a long gap between Football: How Much Do You Really Know?, published by Independent Television Books in the 70s and No Identifiable Remains, his first work of fiction. Bad Marriage, though, followed quickly with Parallel Lives close behind. elsewhere, his first non-fiction was published in 2013.   \n\nA Girl Called Flotsam was published by Muswell Press in November 2017.\n\nJohn lives in Islington, London.\n","website":"www.johntagholm.com"}}],"cover":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"43NGhbEVUkICOII2qQuG0O","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-08-31T14:57:58.759Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-31T14:57:58.759Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"A Girl Called Flotsam Cover","description":"The cover of A Girl Called Flotsam","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/43NGhbEVUkICOII2qQuG0O/b2ad87949ca378b7ba1d7551a4d254e8/9780995482203.jpeg","details":{"size":60242,"image":{"width":360,"height":576}},"fileName":"9780995482203.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"colors":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"4q5WMSMFkQoqKQckWKqEaS","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-20T16:14:37.694Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-20T18:02:51.801Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"colorScheme"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"A Girl Called Flotsam","bg":"#899192","logo1":"#042020","logo2":"#577476","nav":"#899192","footer":"#899192","body":"#042020"}},"press":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3X7t7pTXIACIuY8SwOEUcy","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-31T18:04:44.867Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-31T18:04:44.867Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"This is a very polished and skilful piece of writing.

hilarious satire on the claustrophobic world of poetry, its bitter rivalries bubbling under the cover of polite support, its jockeying for recognition and the relentless round of poetry workshops with their accompanying sexual flings. The book begins with the well known laureate, Fergus Diver, dying in agony after a meal in an Indian restaurant. Bad hygiene? Or something more sinister? Victor Priest, art detective, is asked by Diver’s widow to investigate. He hires a young man and his Glaswegian girl-friend to help. This couple must rank as one of the funniest creations in detective fiction.\n\nA series of murders follows, all of well known poets, an Irish poet is thrown into the sea by an elegant blonde who claims to be an obituarist; an English poetess is assassinated in the cupola of the Reichstag, a Scottish poet dies in agony on an island. What is remarkable about these deaths is that the poets are being murdered in a way that reflects the style of their poems. The entire literary world is in uproar.\n\nA car bomb discovered in Victor Priest’s car provides the answer to the riddle, and a desperate confrontation takes place in a moonlit bay along the southern coast of England.","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1aCVb7fLO0uA4G4aQ0m80E","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:20:48.698Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-10T16:20:48.698Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"John H Williams"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"2eLJQNMG8U2acOQqUSUoYi","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:21:02.905Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-30T14:45:37.541Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Matthew Sweeney","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"2pwwaKjcjmeAQuy6g4Kmgu","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-30T14:45:23.069Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-30T14:50:44.544Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Mathew Sweeney Profile Picture","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/2pwwaKjcjmeAQuy6g4Kmgu/c2f9499a191af422f38baeb7dfcee9f6/Matthew-Sweeney-Resized1.jpg","details":{"size":144210,"image":{"width":550,"height":349}},"fileName":"Matthew-Sweeney-Resized1.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}}],"cover":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5H9fAF7Uha2WG8Yqcu6kOI","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-23T13:28:19.414Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-23T13:28:19.414Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Death Comes","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/5H9fAF7Uha2WG8Yqcu6kOI/6f58fe82bad038ecc9c6451be322b293/Death_Comes.jpg","details":{"size":66262,"image":{"width":420,"height":582}},"fileName":"Death_Comes.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"primaryQuote":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3rQPOXmsSs2cGk22Km844Q","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-10T20:28:29.727Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-10T20:28:29.727Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"This book is very funny indeed","author":"Spectator"}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"53qe9G01zGa8YA6C6wyOo6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-10T20:45:42.206Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-10T20:45:42.206Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"I love her writing","author":"Edmund White"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"6ILqPglhM4eYKyuecQACwS","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-10T20:43:54.293Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-10T20:43:54.293Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Se7en meets The Silence of the Lambs in this masterfully written fast-paced thriller from the award winning author of Forsaken","author":"goodreads"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"4Tb0O3kARa40iWomWEoscm","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-10T20:43:29.644Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-10T20:43:29.644Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"This is a very good book.

After leaving the University of Kent he responded to a newspaper advertisement: Children’s writer needs assistant. Pipe-smokers and those with beards need not apply. He was neither and so became Hawk-eye to Big Chief I-SPY, the writer of the famous series of factual books for children. Within weeks he was writing the regular I-SPY column in the Daily Mail and went on to produce several of the books, including I-SPY Football, Cricket, At The Airport, Birds, Foreign Coins and Cats, a valuable grounding for the world of fiction writing which was to follow later.\n\nAfter spells at the IBA, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (now Ofcom), John joined Thames Television in 1976 and stayed for thirteen years, working first in sport and then in the documentary and features department.  He was programme editor of the pioneering daytime programme, Afternoon Plus which later transferred to Channel 4 as Mavis on 4. When Thames lost its franchise he formed Pineapple Productions and became an independent producer, making programmes for the BBC, ITV and several of the newly emerging digital channels. John continues to make programmes as a freelance producer and director.\n\nHe has written all his working life, for newspapers, magazines, radio and television. There was a long gap between Football: How Much Do You Really Know?, published by Independent Television Books in the 70s and No Identifiable Remains, his first work of fiction. Bad Marriage, though, followed quickly with Parallel Lives close behind. elsewhere, his first non-fiction was published in 2013.   \n\nA Girl Called Flotsam was published by Muswell Press in November 2017.\n\nJohn lives in Islington, London.\n","website":"www.johntagholm.com"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3m5dQlwXwImsuUqcuw6aCe","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-26T19:31:33.237Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-26T19:31:33.237Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Original and intriguing, a page-turner","author":"Richard Barber"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"gWdRsanScSYGycgA8oSiy","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-26T19:31:06.036Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-26T19:31:06.036Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Many layered, intricate and enchanting","author":"Rosie Thomas"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3AmgOKwPTqIA4yscmIaooW","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T14:20:52.694Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-26T19:29:20.114Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Karen Maloney","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3neVsimi2c0aCI0a0oAQ8o","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-26T19:28:56.748Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-30T14:51:22.530Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Karen Maloney Profile Picture","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/61jbytowofta/3neVsimi2c0aCI0a0oAQ8o/b65cbd9d23ac46922569549ceffdca2f/B.jpg","details":{"size":4937780,"image":{"width":2592,"height":3872}},"fileName":"B.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"biography":"Dr Karen Moloney has spent most of her life as a psychologist and executive coach, developing the character of leaders to meet the  demands of senior jobs in the business world. \n\nShe is the author of several books, a full-length piece of musical theatre and two blogs, all of which draw on her fascination with strength of character in adversity.
