But the star of the book is uncle Sol, “a short, bald, bull of a man ready for a fight,” a human Brillo pad, always abrasive and ready to scour his nearest and dearest with an argument.\n\n'The first 160 pages tell the story of Russ’s childhood and adolescence, battling with parents, teachers, and later, girlfriends who apparently hadn’t been told that it was the Swinging Sixties. It is hilarious, but even here, there are hints of something darker to come. Jacob is constantly telling his family how he put down someone with a perfect one-liner or comeback line but, one day, Russ witnesses an encounter between his father and another driver in a car park and later, overhearing Jacob’s account, full of the usual bravado, “remembered triumphs fell to dust.”\n\n'The next chapter describes a nerdish music appreciation teacher and ends with a twist so powerful that it is worth the price of the book on its own.\n\n'The second, darker half contains some of the most moving accounts of illness and death I have read in years, punctured only once by a laugh-out-loud moment of dark comedy which all fans of Uncle Sol will relish.'

His home life is a set of estrangements from his troubled wife Imogen, his angry student son Ricky and the au pair Inez, whose continuing presence in the house he can’t quite explain. William Newgate is himself recovering from the serious condition of alcoholism. \n\nHis life is thrown into chaos by the arrival of a young patient, Serena, who is convinced he has the answers to her confused and abused life. In unsparing detail he records the development of their relationship – a dangerous and reckless liaison which will almost certainly spell the end of his career, and more, if it comes to light – as it surely will. \n\nThe Notes of Dr. Newgate is a richly comic but profound study of addiction in its myriad forms – not just drink and drugs but also the lethal lures of gambling, power, lust, even love and faith themselves.","bookEdition":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"4NBzQQTJQAGmGIyGeOWY2E","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:40:10.822Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:27:59.941Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"The

Victor Priest, art detective, is asked by Diver’s widow to investigate. He hires a young man and his Glaswegian girl-friend to help. This couple must rank as one of the funniest creations in detective fiction.\n\nA series of murders follows, all of well known poets, an Irish poet is thrown into the sea by an elegant blonde who claims to be an obituarist; an English poetess is assassinated in the cupola of the Reichstag, a Scottish poet dies in agony on an island. What is remarkable about these deaths is that the poets are being murdered in a way that reflects the style of their poems. The entire literary world is in uproar.\n\nA car bomb discovered in Victor Priest’s car provides the answer to the riddle, and a desperate confrontation takes place in a moonlit bay along the southern coast of England.","bookEdition":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"4bL2ssYuWIwkAGUekSkEsw","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:43:50.914Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:38:39.405Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Death Comes for the Poets Paperback","format":"Paperback","isbn":"9780957213609","price":"12","pageCount":"316"}}],"releaseDate":"2012-10-01T00:00+01:00","cover":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5H9fAF7Uha2WG8Yqcu6kOI","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-23T13:28:19.414Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-23T13:28:19.414Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Death Comes","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/5H9fAF7Uha2WG8Yqcu6kOI/6f58fe82bad038ecc9c6451be322b293/Death_Comes.jpg","details":{"size":66262,"image":{"width":420,"height":582}},"fileName":"Death_Comes.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"2mYEeuqJwkIWOEsUgaSCaO","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-31T15:12:09.606Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-31T18:15:54.190Z","revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"colorScheme"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Last Train to Helsingor","bg":"#8ED3DF","logo1":"#666666","logo2":"#8D1D12","nav":"#8ED3DF","footer":"#8ED3DF","body":"#77B1BB"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3m7zTWgS3YwowMw4uwEOe4","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-22T15:45:02.567Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T15:56:41.487Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"generalSettings"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"booksLinkText":"our collection","aboutLinkText":"who we are","footerText":"© Muswell Press 2017","facebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/MuswellPress?fref=ts","twitterUrl":"https://twitter.com/MuswellPress","defaultColors":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1P6lYXeYWwUK6Qc6ycmuUw","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-22T15:54:56.280Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T15:56:22.373Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"colorScheme"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Default","bg":"#fff","logo1":"#444","logo2":"#93DADC","nav":"#fff","footer":"#fff","body":"#fff"}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"58gvEbqpHOUiKI066aSQOy","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:24:44.652Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T14:12:04.093Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Jan Woolf","biography":"Jan Woolf is a painter, writer, producer and reviewer.

This one is a delight, beautifully written, funny and deeply sad in turn.\n\n'It tells the story of Russell-Morgan-Stern, a photographer, his irascible, strangely obsessive father, Jacob; and his mother, Beryl, a Jewish Marge Simpson. But the star of the book is uncle Sol, “a short, bald, bull of a man ready for a fight,” a human Brillo pad, always abrasive and ready to scour his nearest and dearest with an argument.\n\n'The first 160 pages tell the story of Russ’s childhood and adolescence, battling with parents, teachers, and later, girlfriends who apparently hadn’t been told that it was the Swinging Sixties. It is hilarious, but even here, there are hints of something darker to come. Jacob is constantly telling his family how he put down someone with a perfect one-liner or comeback line but, one day, Russ witnesses an encounter between his father and another driver in a car park and later, overhearing Jacob’s account, full of the usual bravado, “remembered triumphs fell to dust.”\n\n'The next chapter describes a nerdish music appreciation teacher and ends with a twist so powerful that it is worth the price of the book on its own.\n\n'The second, darker half contains some of the most moving accounts of illness and death I have read in years, punctured only once by a laugh-out-loud moment of dark comedy which all fans of Uncle Sol will relish.'

The story reflects on the halting journey from boyhood to manhood, the choices that people make and their consequences. Through the fragile yet implacable logic of the inner lives of the characters, we see how lives can be lost to drugs, sons lost to mothers and how inner city riots might happen. The complexities of familial, community, class and relationship based loyalties are examined with humour and hard-hitting compassion.\n\nPaul Connor-Kearns was born in Oldham and spent his formative years travelling and working in Europe and the Middle East. He travelled to Australia in the late nineteen eighties and has lived there for twenty years - over a decade of them with Aboriginal people. Paul returned to the UK in 2005 and it was this ‘coming home’ that led to him writing Cleaning Up, his first novel.","bookEdition":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3oXyXjDp1mAOEWUGiywGmW","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:42:15.347Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:41:01.467Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Cleaning Up Paperback","format":"Paperback","isbn":"9780957213630","price":"8.99","dimensions":"210 x 140mm","pageCount":"370"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"7ALP1vUodaew4GYwi8ek4I","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-13T13:41:22.448Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:41:22.448Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Cleaning Up eBook","format":"eBook","isbn":"9780957556805"}}],"releaseDate":"2013-05-01T00:00+01:00","cover":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1KVRZKNl4w6iym6QeCwuWo","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-23T13:23:57.112Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-23T13:23:57.112Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Cleaning+up full spread revised-1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/1KVRZKNl4w6iym6QeCwuWo/a722fbf8426226c1e811a2ff4da10866/Cleaning_up_full_spread_revised-1.png","details":{"size":1649790,"image":{"width":1000,"height":1465}},"fileName":"Cleaning+up_full_spread_revised-1.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3AmgOKwPTqIA4yscmIaooW","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T14:20:52.694Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-10T14:20:52.694Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Karen Maloney"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"7uQ615kYo0sKa8oIGEUgO4","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-13T13:24:06.315Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:24:06.315Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Alan Mackie"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"6Spj9WaFqgCqCQoeiw6ImW","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-22T15:34:36.104Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T15:06:56.845Z","revision":9,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"aboutPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Who We Are","text":"Muswell Press is a proudly independent publisher of great books, both fiction and non-fiction.

It follows their fate from the time of the signing of the Munich Treaty on 1 October 1 1938 which gave the Germans the right to invade the Sudetenland, the German section of the country. This was followed by the Reich’s illegal invasion of the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. \n\nThe family’s fate mirrors that of today’s Syrian refugees, victims of a political power over which they have no control.\n\nThe book also relates the political machinations that took place during this period.  France and England had signed a treaty with Czechoslovakia which obliged them to defend the country if it was threatened. Chamberlain, however, negotiated appeasement with Hitler and the treaty was not honoured.  It spelled the death of a democracy and launched World War 2.","bookEdition":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"48Z4Lpn3ws6wc8UGSWYIo2","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:38:41.628Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:44:40.709Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"A

Take The Walk to the Paradise Garden (Muswell Press £8.99) by north-London based New Yorker Leon Arden. I’d never heard of him or, indeed, his publishers and might have foolishly passed this by. But you can judge a book by its opening pages and once I had started, I was hooked. This one is a delight, beautifully written, funny and deeply sad in turn.\n\n'It tells the story of Russell-Morgan-Stern, a photographer, his irascible, strangely obsessive father, Jacob; and his mother, Beryl, a Jewish Marge Simpson. But the star of the book is uncle Sol, “a short, bald, bull of a man ready for a fight,” a human Brillo pad, always abrasive and ready to scour his nearest and dearest with an argument.\n\n'The first 160 pages tell the story of Russ’s childhood and adolescence, battling with parents, teachers, and later, girlfriends who apparently hadn’t been told that it was the Swinging Sixties. It is hilarious, but even here, there are hints of something darker to come. Jacob is constantly telling his family how he put down someone with a perfect one-liner or comeback line but, one day, Russ witnesses an encounter between his father and another driver in a car park and later, overhearing Jacob’s account, full of the usual bravado, “remembered triumphs fell to dust.”\n\n'The next chapter describes a nerdish music appreciation teacher and ends with a twist so powerful that it is worth the price of the book on its own.\n\n'The second, darker half contains some of the most moving accounts of illness and death I have read in years, punctured only once by a laugh-out-loud moment of dark comedy which all fans of Uncle Sol will relish.'

William Newgate is himself recovering from the serious condition of alcoholism. \n\nHis life is thrown into chaos by the arrival of a young patient, Serena, who is convinced he has the answers to her confused and abused life. In unsparing detail he records the development of their relationship – a dangerous and reckless liaison which will almost certainly spell the end of his career, and more, if it comes to light – as it

Victor Priest, art detective, is asked by Diver’s widow to investigate. He hires a young man and his Glaswegian girl-friend to help.

Russell, the only son of Jacob and Beryl, becomes painfully aware, as he grows from childhood to adolescence, of his mother’s intellectual failings and his father’s need to control everyone around him. He makes his escape into a relationship with a beautiful young English girl. Their bliss is not to be. Jacob suffers a stroke, is paralysed and confined to a wheelchair. His life is unbearable and he begs Russell to help him end it. His son refuses but there is worse to come. Jacob tries to kill himself by a series of increasingly bizarre and desperate methods and Russell is forced to consider a move that could destroy his own life. This gripping novel deals with all the ramifications of euthanasia and how it impacts on a family, no matter what choices they make. Its theme is increasingly topical and although the book is suffused with comedy, it is both disturbing and uplifting.'","bookEdition":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"7iO9dsgnqEG6408s6YagiI","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-13T13:35:42.879Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:35:42.879Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"The Walk to the Paradise Garden eBook","format":"eBook","isbn":"9780956892003"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5jq2utaMfuWqMqw2i8MIiE","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-13T13:36:07.765Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:36:22.935Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"The Walk to the Paradise Garden Paperback","format":"Paperback","isbn":"9780956557599","price":"8.99","dimensions":"210 x 148 mm","pageCount":"298"}}],"releaseDate":"2011-06-01T00:00+01:00","cover":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"2xFEQOOphiaQUIYg2IqI0A","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-23T13:29:28.717Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-23T13:29:28.717Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Leon Arden Cover","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/2xFEQOOphiaQUIYg2IqI0A/b40e2745c9622d2756a866d3f0f64ce2/Leon_Arden_Cover.jpg","details":{"size":22054,"image":{"width":420,"height":595}},"fileName":"Leon_Arden_Cover.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"press":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5dPNdx0Iru8ywoiICEaesY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-13T13:37:04.454Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:37:04.454Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"It’s funny, touching, and ultimately both upsetting and moving.

But you can judge a book by its opening pages and once I had started, I was hooked. This one is a delight, beautifully written, funny and deeply sad in turn.\n\n'It tells the story of Russell-Morgan-Stern, a photographer, his irascible, strangely obsessive father, Jacob; and his mother, Beryl, a Jewish Marge Simpson. But the star of the book is uncle Sol, “a short, bald, bull of a man ready for a fight,” a human Brillo pad, always abrasive and ready to scour his nearest and dearest with an argument.\n\n'The first 160 pages tell the story of Russ’s childhood and adolescence, battling with parents, teachers, and later, girlfriends who apparently hadn’t been told that it was the Swinging Sixties. It is hilarious, but even here, there are hints of something darker to come. Jacob is constantly telling his family how he put down someone with a perfect one-liner or comeback line but, one day, Russ witnesses an encounter between his father and another driver in a car park and later, overhearing Jacob’s account, full of the usual bravado, “remembered triumphs fell to dust.”\n\n'The next chapter describes a nerdish music appreciation teacher and ends with a twist so powerful that it is worth the price of the book on its own.\n\n'The second, darker half contains some of the most moving accounts of illness and death I have read in years, punctured only once by a laugh-out-loud moment of dark comedy which all fans of Uncle Sol will relish.'

The story reflects on the halting journey from boyhood to manhood, the choices that people make and their consequences. Through the fragile yet implacable logic of the inner lives of the characters, we see how lives can be lost to drugs, sons lost to mothers and how inner city riots might happen. The complexities of familial, community, class and relationship based loyalties are examined with humour and hard-hitting compassion.\n\nPaul Connor-Kearns was born in Oldham and spent his formative years travelling and working in Europe and the Middle East. He travelled to Australia in the late nineteen eighties and has lived there for twenty years - over a decade of them with Aboriginal people. Paul returned to the UK in 2005 and it was this ‘coming home’ that led to him writing Cleaning Up, his first novel.","bookEdition":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3oXyXjDp1mAOEWUGiywGmW","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:42:15.347Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:41:01.467Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Cleaning Up Paperback","format":"Paperback","isbn":"9780957213630","price":"8.99","dimensions":"210 x 140mm","pageCount":"370"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"7ALP1vUodaew4GYwi8ek4I","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-13T13:41:22.448Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:41:22.448Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Cleaning Up eBook","format":"eBook","isbn":"9780957556805"}}],"releaseDate":"2013-05-01T00:00+01:00","cover":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1KVRZKNl4w6iym6QeCwuWo","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-23T13:23:57.112Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-23T13:23:57.112Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Cleaning+up full spread revised-1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/1KVRZKNl4w6iym6QeCwuWo/a722fbf8426226c1e811a2ff4da10866/Cleaning_up_full_spread_revised-1.png","details":{"size":1649790,"image":{"width":1000,"height":1465}},"fileName":"Cleaning+up_full_spread_revised-1.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3AmgOKwPTqIA4yscmIaooW","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T14:20:52.694Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-10T14:20:52.694Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Karen Maloney"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"7uQ615kYo0sKa8oIGEUgO4","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-13T13:24:06.315Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:24:06.315Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Alan Mackie"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"6Spj9WaFqgCqCQoeiw6ImW","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-22T15:34:36.104Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T15:06:56.845Z","revision":9,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"aboutPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Who We Are","text":"Muswell Press is a proudly independent publisher of great books, both fiction and non-fiction.

It follows their fate from the time of the signing of the Munich Treaty on 1 October 1 1938 which gave the Germans the right to invade the Sudetenland, the German section of the country. This was followed by the Reich’s illegal invasion of the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. \n\nThe family’s fate mirrors that of today’s Syrian refugees, victims of a political power over which they have no control.\n\nThe book also relates the political machinations that took place during this period.  France and England had signed a treaty with Czechoslovakia which obliged them to defend the country if it was threatened. Chamberlain, however, negotiated appeasement with Hitler and the treaty was not honoured.  It spelled the death of a democracy and launched World War 2.","bookEdition":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"48Z4Lpn3ws6wc8UGSWYIo2","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:38:41.628Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:44:40.709Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"A
