After leaving the University of Kent he responded to a newspaper advertisement: Children’s writer needs assistant. Pipe-smokers and those with beards need not apply. He was neither and so became Hawk-eye to Big Chief I-SPY, the writer of the famous series of factual books for children. Within weeks he was writing the regular I-SPY column in the Daily Mail and went on to produce several of the books, including I-SPY Football, Cricket, At The Airport, Birds, Foreign Coins and Cats, a valuable grounding for the world of fiction writing which was to follow later.\n\nAfter spells at the IBA, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (now Ofcom), John joined Thames Television in 1976 and stayed for thirteen years, working first in sport and then in the documentary and features department.  He was programme editor of the pioneering daytime programme, Afternoon Plus which later transferred to Channel 4 as Mavis on 4. When Thames lost its franchise he formed Pineapple Productions and became an independent producer, making programmes for the BBC, ITV and several of the newly emerging digital channels. John continues to make programmes as a freelance producer and director.\n\nHe has written all his working life, for newspapers, magazines, radio and television. There was a long gap between Football: How Much Do You Really Know?, published by Independent Television Books in the 70s and No Identifiable Remains, his first work of fiction. Bad Marriage, though, followed quickly with Parallel Lives close behind. elsewhere, his first non-fiction was published in 2013.   \n\nA Girl Called Flotsam was published by Muswell Press in November 2017.\n\nJohn lives in Islington, London.\n","website":"www.johntagholm.com"}}],"cover":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"43NGhbEVUkICOII2qQuG0O","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-08-31T14:57:58.759Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-31T14:57:58.759Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"A Girl Called Flotsam Cover","description":"The cover of A Girl Called Flotsam","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/43NGhbEVUkICOII2qQuG0O/b2ad87949ca378b7ba1d7551a4d254e8/9780995482203.jpeg","details":{"size":60242,"image":{"width":360,"height":576}},"fileName":"9780995482203.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"colors":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"4q5WMSMFkQoqKQckWKqEaS","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-20T16:14:37.694Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-20T18:02:51.801Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"colorScheme"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"A Girl Called Flotsam","bg":"#899192","logo1":"#042020","logo2":"#577476","nav":"#899192","footer":"#899192","body":"#042020"}},"press":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3X7t7pTXIACIuY8SwOEUcy","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-31T18:04:44.867Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-31T18:04:44.867Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"This is a very polished and skilful piece of writing.

The Persian garden that Karen had planned produced its own problems and it is fascinating to follow her account of how she searched for the right plants for the dry soil and the failures and successes she experienced.

After leaving the University of Kent he responded to a newspaper advertisement: Children’s writer needs assistant. Pipe-smokers and those with beards need not apply. He was neither and so became Hawk-eye to Big Chief I-SPY, the writer of the famous series of factual books for children. Within weeks he was writing the regular I-SPY column in the Daily Mail and went on to produce several of the books, including I-SPY Football, Cricket, At The Airport, Birds, Foreign Coins and Cats, a valuable grounding for the world of fiction writing which was to follow later.\n\nAfter spells at the IBA, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (now Ofcom), John joined Thames Television in 1976 and stayed for thirteen years, working first in sport and then in the documentary and features department.  He was programme editor of the pioneering daytime programme, Afternoon Plus which later transferred to Channel 4 as Mavis on 4. When Thames lost its franchise he formed Pineapple Productions and became an independent producer, making programmes for the BBC, ITV and several of the newly emerging digital channels. John continues to make programmes as a freelance producer and director.\n\nHe has written all his working life, for newspapers, magazines, radio and television. There was a long gap between Football: How Much Do You Really Know?, published by Independent Television Books in the 70s and No Identifiable Remains, his first work of fiction. Bad Marriage, though, followed quickly with Parallel Lives close behind. elsewhere, his first non-fiction was published in 2013.   \n\nA Girl Called Flotsam was published by Muswell Press in November 2017.\n\nJohn lives in Islington, London.\n","website":"www.johntagholm.com"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"WwXaS1yOqIaisQI6M8eoC","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-13T13:49:55.593Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:49:55.593Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Every page harbours a poetic phrase or image.

His most recent novel published in January 2016, is *The Adventures of Wendy Howard-Watt*, a comedy about the life of an ambitious but trouble-prone celebrity interviewer on a struggling national newspaper. \n \nFranks is the author of many plays, including *The Mother Tongue*, which starred Prunella Scales and Gwen Taylor. ('English-Chekhov' wrote Sheridan Morley in *The Spectator*); *The Edge of the Land*, about the great floods of 1953, and *Previous Convictions*, a black domestic comedy.

Take The Walk to the Paradise Garden (Muswell Press £8.99) by north-London based New Yorker Leon Arden. I’d never heard of him or, indeed, his publishers and might have foolishly passed this by. But you can judge a book by its opening pages and once I had started, I was hooked. This one is a delight, beautifully written, funny and deeply sad in turn.\n\n'It tells the story of Russell-Morgan-Stern, a photographer, his irascible, strangely obsessive father, Jacob; and his mother, Beryl, a Jewish Marge Simpson. But the star of the book is uncle Sol, “a short, bald, bull of a man ready for a fight,” a human Brillo pad, always abrasive and ready to scour his nearest and dearest with an argument.\n\n'The first 160 pages tell the story of Russ’s childhood and adolescence, battling with parents, teachers, and later, girlfriends who apparently hadn’t been told that it was the Swinging Sixties. It is hilarious, but even here, there are hints of something darker to come. Jacob is constantly telling his family how he put down someone with a perfect one-liner or comeback line but, one day, Russ witnesses an encounter between his father and another driver in a car park and later, overhearing Jacob’s account, full of the usual bravado, “remembered triumphs fell to dust.”\n\n'The next chapter describes a nerdish music appreciation teacher and ends with a twist so powerful that it is worth the price of the book on its own.\n\n'The second, darker half contains some of the most moving accounts of illness and death I have read in years, punctured only once by a laugh-out-loud moment of dark comedy which all fans of Uncle Sol will relish.'

He makes his escape into a relationship with a beautiful young English girl. Their bliss is not to be. Jacob suffers a stroke, is paralysed and confined to a wheelchair. His life is unbearable and he begs Russell to help him end it. His son refuses but there is worse to come. Jacob tries to kill himself by a series of increasingly bizarre and desperate methods and Russell is forced to consider a move that could destroy his own life.\n\nThis gripping novel deals with all the ramifications of euthanasia and how it impacts on a family, no matter what choices they make. Its theme is increasingly topical and although the book is suffused with comedy, it is both disturbing and uplifting.","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5H5T7Ix6oMyEUiWuY2YA8m","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:20:03.068Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-13T13:36:42.991Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Leon Arden","biography":"Leon Arden is a New Yorker who has settled in England.

hilarious satire on the claustrophobic world of poetry, its bitter rivalries bubbling under the cover of polite support, its jockeying for recognition and the relentless round of poetry workshops with their accompanying sexual flings. The book begins with the well known laureate, Fergus Diver, dying in agony after a meal in an Indian restaurant. Bad hygiene? Or something more sinister? Victor Priest, art detective, is asked by Diver’s widow to investigate. He hires a young man and his Glaswegian girl-friend to help. This couple must rank as one of the funniest creations in detective fiction.\n\nA series of murders follows, all of well known poets, an Irish poet is thrown into the sea by an elegant blonde who claims to be an obituarist; an English poetess is assassinated in the cupola of the Reichstag, a Scottish poet dies in agony on an island. What is remarkable about these deaths is that the poets are being murdered in a way that reflects the style of their poems. The entire literary world is in uproar.\n\nA car bomb discovered in Victor Priest’s car provides the answer to the riddle, and a desperate confrontation takes place in a moonlit bay along the southern coast of England.","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1aCVb7fLO0uA4G4aQ0m80E","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:20:48.698Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-10T16:20:48.698Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"John H Williams"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"2eLJQNMG8U2acOQqUSUoYi","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:21:02.905Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-30T14:45:37.541Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Matthew Sweeney","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"2pwwaKjcjmeAQuy6g4Kmgu","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-30T14:45:23.069Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-30T14:50:44.544Z","revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Mathew Sweeney Profile Picture","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/2pwwaKjcjmeAQuy6g4Kmgu/c2f9499a191af422f38baeb7dfcee9f6/Matthew-Sweeney-Resized1.jpg","details":{"size":144210,"image":{"width":550,"height":349}},"fileName":"Matthew-Sweeney-Resized1.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}}],"cover":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5H9fAF7Uha2WG8Yqcu6kOI","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-23T13:28:19.414Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-23T13:28:19.414Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Death Comes","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/5H9fAF7Uha2WG8Yqcu6kOI/6f58fe82bad038ecc9c6451be322b293/Death_Comes.jpg","details":{"size":66262,"image":{"width":420,"height":582}},"fileName":"Death_Comes.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"primaryQuote":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3rQPOXmsSs2cGk22Km844Q","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-10T20:28:29.727Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-10T20:28:29.727Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"This book is very funny indeed","author":"Spectator"}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"6aKv3VkWd2QgCgSQiA6WcM","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:33:23.373Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-24T13:17:47.074Z","revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"book"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Beckett's Last Act","releaseDate":"2014-09-01T00:00+01:00","bookEdition":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"6e9YeO23ZeqIMEq4QAu26g","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:41:14.597Z","updatedAt":"2017-12-05T14:00:18.621Z","revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Beckett's Last Act Paperback","format":"Paperback","isbn":"9780992817107","price":"9.99","dimensions":"210 x 140mm","amazonProductCode":"0992817102"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5XsToOdYbuiAyYSKQK00SI","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-13T13:40:16.600Z","updatedAt":"2017-12-05T14:00:27.592Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Beckett's Last Act eBook","format":"eBook","isbn":"9780992817138","amazonProductCode":"B00OOZL2G8"}}],"blurb":"During the course of a final rehearsal of Samuel Beckett's two most enigmatic plays, Krapps' Last Tape and Not I,  Mora Grey burrows into the psyches of the production team and of the playwright himself as he watches, pontificates and finally demonstrates how one of his most famous characters should be played.

The first, *Boychester's Bugle* drew ecstatic reviews. *The Times Literary Supplement* called it 'splendidly funny.' For Alan Hollinghurst in *The Observer*, it resembled Keith Waterhouse, while *The Tablet* saw similarities with Flann O'Brien and early Kingsley Amis. The veteran farceur Tom Sharpe found it 'brilliantly comic.'  \n \n*Going Over*, his account of a man walking across the north of England for a reckoning with his aged father, was the winner of a national novella competition. *The Notes of Dr. Newgate*, was a Guardian book of the year in 2013. His most recent novel published in January 2016, is *The Adventures of Wendy Howard-Watt*, a comedy about the life of an ambitious but trouble-prone celebrity interviewer on a struggling national newspaper. \n \nFranks is the author of many plays, including *The Mother Tongue*, which starred Prunella Scales and Gwen Taylor. ('English-Chekhov' wrote Sheridan Morley in *The Spectator*); *The Edge of the Land*, about the great floods of 1953, and *Previous Convictions*, a black domestic comedy.

Simon Callow wrote: 'I am overwhelmed, thrilled, lit up. Virile, vital, virtuosic. Stupendous.' Melvyn Bragg referred to its 'visceral intellectualism' and called it 'a triumph.'\n\nFour of the poems have won international prizes. The title poem is an apocalyptic dream about our capacity for self-destruction and our destruction of Planet Earth.\n\nIt is also a passionately tragic celebration of nature’s power to overcome humanity’s folly. It has already been performed in two theatres. There is comedy in it, but comedy balanced on the edge of catastrophe.","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"18wuJ1zsHQaUmqQgOYaA0a","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T15:28:38.551Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-30T14:47:11.506Z","revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Leo Aylen","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5X9uSOFXgcu2WGckoUa4gK","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-30T14:47:07.122Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-30T14:50:38.505Z","revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Leo Aylen Profile Picture","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/5X9uSOFXgcu2WGckoUa4gK/a7ad8b504593f4dacb08e1f2e33955d1/leo_aylen.jpg","details":{"size":58354,"image":{"width":300,"height":258}},"fileName":"leo_aylen.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"biography":"Leo Aylen was born in South Africa and obtained a First in Classics at Oxford University.

Take The Walk to the Paradise Garden (Muswell Press £8.99) by north-London based New Yorker Leon Arden. I’d never heard of him or, indeed, his publishers and might have foolishly passed this by. But you can judge a book by its opening pages and once I had started, I was hooked. This one is a delight, beautifully written, funny and deeply sad in turn.\n\n'It tells the story of Russell-Morgan-Stern, a photographer, his irascible, strangely obsessive father, Jacob; and his mother, Beryl, a Jewish Marge Simpson. But the star of the book is uncle Sol, “a short, bald, bull of a man ready for a fight,” a human Brillo pad, always abrasive and ready to scour his nearest and dearest with an argument.\n\n'The first 160 pages tell the story of Russ’s childhood and adolescence, battling with parents, teachers, and later, girlfriends who apparently hadn’t been told that it was the Swinging Sixties. It is hilarious, but even here, there are hints of something darker to come. Jacob is constantly telling his family how he put down someone with a perfect one-liner or comeback line but, one day, Russ witnesses an encounter between his father and another driver in a car park and later, overhearing Jacob’s account, full of the usual bravado, “remembered triumphs fell to dust.”\n\n'The next chapter describes a nerdish music appreciation teacher and ends with a twist so powerful that it is worth the price of the book on its own.\n\n'The second, darker half contains some of the most moving accounts of illness and death I have read in years, punctured only once by a laugh-out-loud moment of dark comedy which all fans of Uncle Sol will relish.'

He makes his escape into a relationship with a beautiful young English girl. Their bliss is not to be. Jacob suffers a stroke, is paralysed and confined to a wheelchair. His life is unbearable and he begs Russell to help him end it. His son refuses but there is worse to come. Jacob tries to kill himself by a series of increasingly bizarre and desperate methods and Russell is forced to consider a move that could destroy his own life.\n\nThis gripping novel deals with all the ramifications of euthanasia and how it impacts on a family, no matter what choices they make.

The story reflects on the halting journey from boyhood to manhood, the choices that people make and their consequences. Through the fragile yet implacable logic of the inner lives of the characters, we see how lives can be lost to drugs, sons lost to mothers and how inner city riots might happen. The complexities of familial, community, class and relationship based loyalties are examined with humour and hard-hitting compassion.","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1vvfR2KG6gS0KCWQGIC0sm","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:21:41.695Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-24T13:18:50.437Z","revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Paul Connor-Kearns","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"2fq5w15Zy8YIEkeemoSke6","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-30T14:48:29.734Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-30T14:50:32.674Z","revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Paul Connor-Kearns Profile Picture","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/2fq5w15Zy8YIEkeemoSke6/209305df475a7d122835689576dd287d/1083daecpack.jpg","details":{"size":5079,"image":{"width":160,"height":198}},"fileName":"1083daecpack.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"biography":"Paul Connor-Kearns was born in Oldham and spent his formative years travelling and working in Europe and the Middle East.

('English-Chekhov' wrote Sheridan Morley in *The Spectator*); *The Edge of the Land*, about the great floods of 1953, and *Previous Convictions*, a black domestic comedy.

hilarious satire on the claustrophobic world of poetry, its bitter rivalries bubbling under the cover of polite support, its jockeying for recognition and the relentless round of poetry workshops with their accompanying sexual flings. The book begins with the well known laureate, Fergus Diver, dying in agony after a meal in an Indian restaurant. Bad hygiene? Or something more sinister? Victor Priest, art detective, is asked by Diver’s widow to investigate. He hires a young man and his Glaswegian girl-friend to help. This couple must rank as one of the funniest creations in detective fiction.\n\nA series of murders follows, all of well known poets, an Irish poet is thrown into the sea by an elegant blonde who claims to be an obituarist; an English poetess is assassinated in the cupola of the Reichstag, a Scottish poet dies in agony on an island. What is remarkable about these deaths is that the poets are being murdered in a way that reflects the style of their poems. The entire literary world is in uproar.\n\nA car bomb discovered in Victor Priest’s car provides the answer to the riddle, and a desperate confrontation takes place in a moonlit bay along the southern coast of England.","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"1aCVb7fLO0uA4G4aQ0m80E","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:20:48.698Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-10T16:20:48.698Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"John H Williams"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"2eLJQNMG8U2acOQqUSUoYi","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:21:02.905Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-30T14:45:37.541Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Matthew Sweeney","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"2pwwaKjcjmeAQuy6g4Kmgu","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-30T14:45:23.069Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-30T14:50:44.544Z","revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Mathew Sweeney Profile Picture","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/2pwwaKjcjmeAQuy6g4Kmgu/c2f9499a191af422f38baeb7dfcee9f6/Matthew-Sweeney-Resized1.jpg","details":{"size":144210,"image":{"width":550,"height":349}},"fileName":"Matthew-Sweeney-Resized1.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}}],"cover":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5H9fAF7Uha2WG8Yqcu6kOI","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-10-23T13:28:19.414Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-23T13:28:19.414Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Death Comes","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/61jbytowofta/5H9fAF7Uha2WG8Yqcu6kOI/6f58fe82bad038ecc9c6451be322b293/Death_Comes.jpg","details":{"size":66262,"image":{"width":420,"height":582}},"fileName":"Death_Comes.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"primaryQuote":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"3rQPOXmsSs2cGk22Km844Q","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-10T20:28:29.727Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-10T20:28:29.727Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"press"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"This book is very funny indeed","author":"Spectator"}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"6aKv3VkWd2QgCgSQiA6WcM","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:33:23.373Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-24T13:17:47.074Z","revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"book"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Beckett's Last Act","releaseDate":"2014-09-01T00:00+01:00","bookEdition":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"6e9YeO23ZeqIMEq4QAu26g","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-10T16:41:14.597Z","updatedAt":"2017-12-05T14:00:18.621Z","revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Beckett's Last Act Paperback","format":"Paperback","isbn":"9780992817107","price":"9.99","dimensions":"210 x 140mm","amazonProductCode":"0992817102"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"61jbytowofta"}},"id":"5XsToOdYbuiAyYSKQK00SI","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-10-13T13:40:16.600Z","updatedAt":"2017-12-05T14:00:27.592Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bookEdition"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Beckett's Last Act eBook","format":"eBook","isbn":"9780992817138","amazonProductCode":"B00OOZL2G8"}}],"blurb":"During the course of a final rehearsal of Samuel Beckett's two most enigmatic plays, Krapps' Last Tape and Not I,  Mora Grey burrows into the psyches of the production team and of the playwright himself as he watches, pontificates and finally demonstrates how one of his most famous characters should be played.

The veteran farceur Tom Sharpe found it 'brilliantly comic.'  \n \n*Going Over*, his account of a man walking across the north of England for a reckoning with his aged father, was the winner of a national novella competition. *The Notes of Dr. Newgate*, was a Guardian book of the year in 2013. His most recent novel published in January 2016, is *The Adventures of Wendy Howard-Watt*, a comedy about the life of an ambitious but trouble-prone celebrity interviewer on a struggling national newspaper. \n \nFranks is the author of many plays, including *The Mother Tongue*, which starred Prunella Scales and Gwen Taylor. ('English-Chekhov' wrote Sheridan Morley in *The Spectator*); *The Edge of the Land*, about the great floods of 1953, and *Previous Convictions*, a black domestic comedy. His most recent play, *Looking at Lucian*, premiered at the Theatre Royal Bath to excellent reviews in August 2017. \n \nAlan was a feature writer on *The Times* for 30 years and has twice been shortlisted for a British Press Award.
