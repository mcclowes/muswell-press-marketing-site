	Muswell Press is a proudly independent publisher of great books, both fiction and non-fiction. Sarah and Kate Beal acquired Muswell in 2016. With over 50 years publishing experience between them, at Bloomsbury, Faber, Walker Books, HarperCollins and Ottakar’s Bookshops amongst others, they bring a fresh approach and a wealth of knowledge and enthusiasm to the company.

	We are committed to editorial excellence, high-quality production and marketing our books with flair. We are currently in the process of refreshing and reinvigorating Muswell and our first new title will appear in Autumn 2017 with a fuller list in Spring ’18.
